"B22C","FOUNDRY MOULDING  (moulding refractory materials in general B28B)","B28B","Shaping clay or other ceramic substances","B28B","",""," Vacuum sealed moulding a moulding process wherein a heated pattern is covered with a plastic sheet; a box of loose moulding sand is placed over the pattern and a vacuum is applied to the sand which then conforms to the shape of the sheet; after casting, the vacuum is released and the loose sand falls away from the casting productChaplet metal support that holds a core in place within a mould; molten metal solidifies around the chaplet and fuses it into the finished castingStack mouldsa composite mold made up of stacked sections, each of which produces a complete gate of castings, and poured from a central downgate.Breaker core a core placed in a casting mould between the feeder and the casting cavity; the core provides for a reduced feeder-to-casting contact and enables feeders easily to be broken off from the cast productsInvesting a lost pattern method of moulding using a pattern of wax, plastic, or other material which is coated by a moulding material in slurry or liquid form to be dried and hardened afterwards Lost pattern a pattern (or model) which is destroyed after forming the mould; this can be done by melting out (in the case of a wax pattern) or by burning during casting (in the case of a foam pattern)Core box a box or mould, usually divisible and metallic, in which cores are mouldedFeeder head a reservoir of molten metal connected to a casting to provide additionnal metal to the casting, required as the result of shrinkage before and during solidificationPattern plate a plate foreseen with a pattern to realise at least one mould part (cope or drag); the plate can have only on one side a half pattern, able to realise cope or drag (single sided pattern) or the plate is foreseen on both sides with a half pattern, able to realise both cope and drag (double sided pattern plate or matchplate) Stripping plate a plate which prevents moulding material from dislodging, when removing the pattern from the mouldSprue the mould channel that connects the pouring basin with the runner or, in the absence of a pouring basin , directly into which molten metal is pouredPermanent moulds moulds which are used more than onceSemi -permanent moulds moulds of which a part is used more than once, while the other part has to be renewed after each casting cycleFlask a metal frame used for making and holding a refractory mould","This place covers: Methods, machines and materials for manufacturing moulds or cores used in a foundry; the necessary patterns, accessory devices or tools."
