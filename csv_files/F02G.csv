Stirling engines are divided in three types: Alpha. Pairs of sealed pistons in separate cylinders (no displacer). a. with parallel pistons. b. with cylinders opposed in line. c. with cylinders opposed parallel. Beta. Piston - displacer arrangement: piston and displacer in the same cylinder. Cylinder has a hot end and a cool end: Gamma.
