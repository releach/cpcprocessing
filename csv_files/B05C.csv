A coating may be a solidified layer originally applied as a liquid (e.g. dried paint) or a layer of material which, once applied, remains in a liquid or semi-liquid state (e.g. lubricant).Fluidised-bed techniqueA technique used to cause dry particulate material to behave like a fluid. This is commonly achieved by the introduction of a pressurised fluid into the material and promotes a high degree of contact between the fluid and material.Liquid or fluentdesignates materials which can flow, e.g. liquids, including solutions, dispersions and suspensions, as well as semi-liquids, pastes, melts and particulate materials.Particulate materialsSolid materials in the form of very small pieces, e.g. powders, granules, short fibres or chips.","This place covers: Apparatus or hand tools, in general, for applying liquids or other fluent materials to a surface or part thereof, by any mechanical or physical method, in particular apparatus for obtaining a uniform distribution of liquids or other fluent materials on a surface.
