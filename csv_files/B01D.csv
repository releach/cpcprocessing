SorbentA material which separates a constituent from a fluid mixture containing such constituents. The action in most instances is that of selective retention (i.e. the sorbent removes only the part of the fluid mixture for which it has the greatest affinity). The retained constituent cannot be removed by shaking, brushing or similar mechanical action, but generally can be removed by heating, pressure reduction, or use of a stripping or denuding fluid. Chromatography A process in which a liquid is flowed along a linear path comprising a sorbent, with which the liquid competes in affinity for a constituent of the liquid. The constituent is sorbed from the moving liquid by the relatively immobile sorbent and re-dissolved by a later passing portion of the liquid until an equilibrium of the sorbing-dissolving step is set up causing the constituent to concentrate in a specific volume of the sorbent and to move along the path of the liquid at a rate slower than such liquid. Adsorption chromatography: Separation is based mainly on the differences between the adsorption affinities of the sample components for the surface of an active solid. Partition chromatography Separation is based mainly on differences between the solubilities of the sample components in the stationary phase (gas chromatography) or on differences between the solubilities of the components in the mobile and stationary phases (liquid chromatography). Exclusion chromatography Separation is based mainly on exclusion effects, such as differences in molecular size ( size- exclusion chromatography) and/or shape or charge. Affinity chromatography The particular variant of chromatography in which the unique biological specificity of the analyte and ligand interaction is utilised in the separation. Bonded phase A stationary phase which is covalently bonded to the support particles or to the inside wall of the column tubing.","This place covers: Separating processes and apparatus for treating liquids involving non-selective adsorption with solid sorbents.
