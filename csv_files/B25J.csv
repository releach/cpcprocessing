The International Organization for Standardization gives the following definition of an industrial robot in ISO 8373: an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications. This definition is used by the International Federation of Robotics, the European Robotics Research Network (EURON) and many national standards committees.

An expert system is divided into two sub-systems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules or models. The inference engine applies the rules or models to the known facts to deduce new facts. In a rule based expert system, the knowledge base is represented by an IF-THEN structure, that relates given information of fact in the IF part (so called antecedent, premise or condition) to some action in the THEN part (so called conclusion, consequence or action).  In a model based expert system, the knowledge base is represented by the design and function of the object to be controlled. Illustrative example of subject matter classified in  US 2011208356"
