In the field of washing machine for crockery and/or tableware there exists a clear distinction between washing methods and washing processes. A washing method defines the washing principle according to which a machine works: by utilising water, ultrasonic wave, microwaves, steam, etc. A washing process defines the series of operations performed by a machine to wash the tableware according to a defined washing principle. For example, a conventional domestic dishwasher uses water for washing the crockery and the washing processes of domestic dishwashers usually comprise the series of operations of: rinsing with cold water, washing with water containing detergent and rinsing with hot water. This distinction between washing methods and washing processes is not always used in documents in the field of dishwashers. However, a clear indication that a dishwasher application relates to a washing method and/or process, is given by the subject-matter of the application, which must relate to the way the crockery or the tableware is treated. Does the invention information of the application concern the principle according to which the dishes are treated? Is steam applied to the crockery? Are microwaves used for drying the tableware? Then there is a clear indication that the technical information of the application relates to a washing method. Does the invention information concern the temporal sequence of the machine operational steps affecting the washing cycle of the dishes? Pre-rinse, washing, final rinse and drying? Does the invention information concern the values of the washing parameters affecting the crockery? What will be the value of the water temperature during the rinsing step? What will be the value of the air temperature during the drying step? Then there is a clear indication that the application relates to a washing process."
