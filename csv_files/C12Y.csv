In this subclass, each enzyme is classified according to their EC number of the ""Enzyme Nomenclature"" (as valid on 1 January 2013) recommended by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.The EC number appears in the subgroups within parentheses and is reflected in the classification symbol: the EC number with the notation a.bb.cc.ddd is rendered into a CPC symbol   ABB/CCDDD (with no trailing zeroes at the end) where: EC a.bb.cc.ddd CPC symbol a ranges from 1-6 A = 1-6 b ranges from 1-99(*) B = 01-99 c ranges from 1-99(*) C = 01-99 d ranges from 1-400(*) D = 001-400 (*) not all numbers are used Examples: Alcohol dehydrogenase: EC 1.1.1.1.-------- Togavirin: EC 3.4.21.90------ Hepsin: EC 3.4.21.106----- Cobaltochelatase EC 6.6.1.2----------"
