It is characterised by a comparatively high material removal rate.Polishing Polishing means mechanically finishing the surface of a work so as to improve, e.g. smoothen, its surface, without substantial change of dimension or shape of the work as would occur in grinding.AbradingAbrading is used in its most general sense to mean mechanically removing material by a multitude of fixed or loose particles that are forced into the surface of the work so that each particle cuts away small chips of materialHoningHoning means abrading by means of one or more, often compliant, fine grit abrasive blocks or stones along a controlled path of combined movements, including a reciprocating movement, in order to smoothen a surface or to produce a defined surface texture such as a cross-hatch pattern.SuperfinishingSuperfinishing means abrading by means of one or more fine grit abrading blocks or an abrasive band pressed by a shoe (bandfinishing) along a controlled path of combined movements. Typically, the block or shoe is oscillated with a short stroke and relatively high frequency while the work is rotated, in order to improve surface finish or produce a defined surface texture such as a cross-hatch pattern. Superfinishing is also referred to as microfinishing, or short-stroke honing, in the art.LappingLapping is surface finishing by rubbing the surface of the work and the surface of a lapping tool, e.g. a lapping plate or lapping pad, that is mostly shaped corresponding to the work surface, against each other, mainly with loose abrasives rolling and sliding between the surfaces; the abrasives may be dispersed in a liquid medium, i.e. a slurry, or in a paste, or fixed to the lapping pad BurnishingBurnishing means plastically deforming a work on a small scale by means of rubbing or rolling a tool, e.g. a roller or ball, on the work. It is not an abrading operation but used as an alternative to abrasive finishing operations in order to improve the surface finish or surface hardness of the work. Conditioning Conditioning is used in its most general sense to mean truing by removing material from the abrasive tool to maintain tool geometry, e.g. concentricity, or to (re-) profile a form into the abrasive surface, sharpening by removing small amounts of binding material from the abrasive surface to expose abrasive grains or by breaking abrasive grains to produce sharper cutting edges on the grain,cleaning the surface of an abrasive tool or a lapping pad in order to remove debris from the space between the grains or pores of the pad.","This place covers: Grinding or polishing processes not particular to specific machines, devices or work, including the use of auxiliary equipment in connection with such processes, e.g. of grinding with ultrasonic frequency; Machines, devices or processes for sharpening cutting edges, or accessories therefor, adapted e.g. to the cutting edges of milling cutters, turning or planing tools, drills or cutting blades; Machines, devices or processes for grinding, or accessories therefor, adapted to surfaces on work with particular geometric shapes, e.g. surfaces of revolution or plane, lens shaped or spherical surfaces, adapted to particular surface elements on work, e.g. to edges, bevels, grooves, seat surfaces, or to burr removal adapted to surfaces of particular work, e.g. turbine blades, dies, work of non-circular cross section, such as shafts of polygonal cross-section, sharp pointed workpieces or workpieces with arcuate surfaces, adapted to properties of the material of articles to be ground, adapted for grinding controlled by patterns, drawings, magnetic tapes or the like, e.g. by deriving a required shape from a pattern, of the same or a different shape or scale, by a mechanism controlled by a member following the pattern, embodied as a particular form of machine, e.g. using grinding or polishing belts, as portable grinding machine or as grinding machine of universal type, whereby in connection with glass the terms ""grinding"" and ""polishing"" are treated as being equivalent.
