(2) In some instances in this definition, the term "" vehicle "" has been qualified by another word which takes its meaning outside the scope of (1) above (e.g. ""rail vehicle ""), in which case the word "" vehicle "" takes its broader meaning in (1) above (i.e. without the specified exception of particular types of vehicles from its scope). The reader can determine from the context whether an occurrence of the word "" vehicle "" in this definition falls within the meaning stated in (1) or (2). ","This place covers: Vehicles that are specifically designed, or specially adapted, to be wholly or partially supported, at least some of the time during their travel over a surface (e.g. water, land, floors, railways, roads, sidewalks, runways), by a thin cushion or film of gaseous fluid (e.g. air). Wherein the gaseous fluid of the cushion or film is at least partially: supplied or generated by means located on the vehicle and propelled from the vehicle towards a nearby reaction surface that does not form a part of the vehicle (e.g. ground, lake surface, roadway) and against which the fluid pushes to sustain the vehicle a relatively short distance (e.g. less than the height of the vehicle) above the reaction surface. Components of the above vehicles having structural features that limit them to use with vehicles supported during travel on a thin cushion or film of gaseous fluid. The making of vehicles that are specifically designed to be: exclusively supported by a thin cushion or film of gaseous fluid when traveling and unrestricted to a particular path by fixed guiding structure. Specially adapted method steps or apparatus, which are part of an entire manufacturing process, for the manufacture of components essential to forming or maintaining the thin cushion or film of gaseous fluid for vehicles of the type that are only partially supported, or supported only part time during travel, by the gaseous fluid."
