The following model describes the operator control device: A) an operator actuated part (the part coming in contact with the human body to receive a command) B) mechanisms that do not transmit the command (e.g. ratchet mechanisms, mechanisms with hysteresis, return spring mechanisms) C) command treating mechanisms (i.e. mechanical systems aimed at transmitting, amplifying, converting or delaying the command received) D) a commutation part (aimed at performing the final operation, e.g. electric contact being actuated). If the invention is concerned with A or B, it is classified in respectively   or  . If the invention is concerned with C, and the mechanism is a mechanism in which: 1. the ratio of motion or force between the controlling member and the controlled member is altered (e.g. US 2009/0095100 with brake pedal, which includes a mechanism capable of varying a ratio between an output amount of a push rod connected to a master cylinder and an operation amount of the brake pedal), 2. repeated movement of the controlling member produces increments of movement of the controlled member (e.g. US4311060 a parking brake in which, when the brake handle is pulled up, the brake cable is winded around a rotating member. By repeating the above operation of the brake handle, the rotating member is intermittently rotated until necessary length of the brake cable is wound up to effect firm locking of the parking brake), or 3. repeated movement of the controlling member moves the controlled member through a cycle of distinct positions (e.g. US3187602; push button wherein a contact is switched on or off by repeated pushing), it is classified in groups   -  If the invention is concerned with C, and it is not one of the mechanisms under point 1 - 3 above, it is classified in other fields, e.g.  ,  ,   -  ,  ,  ,  , etc. If the invention is concerned with D, it is classified in other fields, e.g.  ,  ,   -  ,  ,  ,  , etc."
