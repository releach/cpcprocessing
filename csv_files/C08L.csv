CPC will be updated/corrected once this inconsistency in IPC is resolved.Classification guidance:Compositions of single polymers with organic or inorganic additives are not classified in this subclass but in .Compositions are classified according to the relative proportions by weight of only the macromolecular constituents; a single symbol is given according to the macromolecular constituent present in the highest proportion; if some or all of these constituents are present in equal proportions, the composition is classified according to each of these constituents.In the case of copolymers, the main group in  is selected on the basis of the monomer in majority for each macromolecular component of the composition, unless otherwise stated.The entire composition is also classified under the form of a C-Set (see C-Sets classification below).All hydrogels including those from a single polymer are classified in the  -  and  -  group corresponding to the matrix polymer and  and  -  (see definitions of  -  and  - ).While crosslinked hydrogels are classified in , their compositions are in . The crosslinking process for making gel/hydrogel is classified in . Allocation of indexing codes:Orthogonal Indexing Codes  -  are used to specify the role, applications and the characteristics of the polymer compositions.Orthogonal Indexing codes may be allocated in conjunction with C-sets symbols. In these situations, allocations of specific indexing codes are indicated with the related C-Sets in C-Sets classification. Breakdown indexing codes in  -  are used as single symbols for classification, but they are not used in forming of C-Set symbols (See C-Sets classification below).Orthogonal symbols  -  are not used for classification after April 2012. However, they can be used for C-Sets searches for the documents classified prior to Aril 2012. See C-sets search below.Combination sets (C-Sets):In this subclass, C-Sets classification is applied to the following groups, listed in the table below, if the document discloses a pertinent combination of technical features that cannot be covered by the allocation of a single symbol.

If the C-Sets rule is applicable to all groups of a subclass, it is located at the subclass level only. If the same C-Sets rule is applicable to multiple groups or subgroups within the same subclass, the C-Sets rule is placed at the highest group or subgroup of the multiple groups.C-Sets statement: #C8La and #C8LbIn groups  - , the compositions of macromolecular compounds and any additives(s) are classified in the form of C-Sets.In #C8La , the base symbol, representing the major polymer of the composition (in term of weight percentage) is taken from the groups  - , whereas the subsequent symbol(s) representing the polymer(s) as minor component(s) of the composition (in term of weight percentage) is (are) taken from the groups  - .In the case that two polymers are present in equal amounts (50:50), two C-sets are given.In #C8Lb, in addition to the polymers as shown in #C8La , further subsequent symbol(s), representing compound(s) used as an additive(s), are taken from the groups  -  (for the additive(s)).C-Sets syntax rules:Each of these C-Sets should contain two or more symbols from .C-Sets of #C8La shall contain two or more symbols.C-Sets of #C8Lb shall contain three or more symbols.Duplicate symbols are allowed in these C-Sets. Breakdown indexing codes are not allowed as either base or subsequent symbols.The order of  symbols in C-Sets of # C8La and # C8Lb is relevant as it reflects the relative amounts of the polymers. The  symbols for the additives always appear after the symbols for the polymers (). The order of  symbols of additives is not relevant if there are more than one additive in the composition. (Note: This does not apply for #C8Ka. See #C8Ka rules in ).In addition, both #C8La and #C8Lb C-Sets can also be allocated in conjunction with orthogonal indexing codes  - . For example, a composition containing a polyamide in majority, a polyester and a polyethylene is classified as (, , ) and in . When the composition comprises one Si-based polymer of  - , one additional symbol is allocated in addition to the C-Set, which is selected from the range  - , corresponding to the Si-based polymer component detailed in the C-Set.In all cases, a single symbol is also given according to the macromolecular constituent present in the highest proportion.C-Sets examples:#C8La : A composition of polybutadiene rubber () (present in majority) combined with epoxy resin () is classified as (, ).#C8La : A composition of 50 wt.% of polybutadiene rubber () combined with 50 wt.% of epoxy resin () is classified as (, ) and (, ). Two C-sets are allocated because both materials are in equal amounts. #C8La : A composition of PET and PBT is classified as (, ).#C8La : Blends of bisphenol A based polycarbonate with a tetrachloro BPA based polycarbonate is classified as (, ). Duplicate symbols are allowed if two different polymers in the composition have same symbols.#C8Lb: A composition of a thermoplastic Nylon 6,6 () (present in majority) combined with a thermoplastic polyester resin (), a reinforcing or bulking filler (), and a triarylphosphate fire retardant () is classified as (, , , )C-Sets statement: #C8La(Si) and #C8Lb(Si)#C8La (Si) and #C8Lb(Si) are a special use of #C8La and #C8Lb for a composition comprising two or more Si-based macromolecular compounds in the sense of .In groups  - , the feature relating to a composition comprising one non Si-based polymer in majority with two or more Si-based macromolecular compounds is classified in the form of C-Sets.In #C8La (Si) and #C8Lb(Si), the base symbol, representing the polymer in majority, is taken from the groups  -  (excluding  - ), whereas the subsequent symbols representing the polymers in minority are taken from the groups  -  (for the Si-based macromolecular compound in majority), and from  (for the Si-based polymer(s) in minority).In addition, #C8Lb(Si) further includes subsequent symbols representing compound(s) used as an additive(s) from the groups  - .In addition to C-Sets, one or more additional symbols are allocated, which are selected from the range  -  corresponding to each of the Si-based macromolecular compound components detailed in the C-Set. In all cases, a single symbol is also given according to the macromolecular constituent present in the highest proportion.C-Sets syntax rules:C-Sets of #C8La(Si) shall contain at least three symbols.C-Sets of #C8Lb(Si) shall contain at least four symbols.While duplicate symbols are allowed in these C-Sets, only one symbol selected from the range  -  is permitted per C-Set.Breakdown codes are not allowed either as base or as subsequent symbols.The order of  symbols in C-Sets of # C8La(Si) and #C8Lb(Si) is relevant as it reflects the relative amounts of the polymers. The  symbols for the additives always appear after the symbols for the polymers (). The order of  symbols of additives is not relevant if there is more than one additive in the composition. C-Sets examples:#C8La (Si): A composition comprising, in descending amounts by weight, a polyester in accordance with , an amine-substituted polysiloxane in accordance with  and an epoxy-substituted polysiloxane in accordance with  is classified as (, , ) and in (ADD) and  (ADD). #C8Lb(Si): A composition comprising, in descending amounts by weight, a polyester in accordance with , an amine-substituted polysiloxane in accordance with  and an epoxy-substituted polysiloxane in accordance with  and carbon black is classified as (, , , ) and in  (ADD) and  (ADD).Also see  for more examples of compositions comprising Si-containing polymers. C-Sets searches:C-Sets search queries may be made according to C-Sets classification rules described in ,  and related subclasses e.g.  and .In addition, Search rule #C8Lz, #C9Dz (see ), and #C9Jz (see ) may be followed to search for polymers in documents classified prior to April 2012.Search rule #C8LzTo search a composition of two polymers, build search queries as follows:( of the polymer in majority,  - ). The subsequent symbol refers to the appropriate subgroup of  -  according to the last place rule. The search statement can also be further refined by searching the polymer in minority by using its  as ADD (for documents classified between 2003 and April 2012).In the case where two polymers are present in equal amounts (50:50), either polymer can be treated as majority, build to two C-Sets search queries wherein either polymer as majority.Example 1: A composition comprising polystyrene in majority () and polyester (Polycaprolactone) () in minority Search Queries: (, ), and optionally  (ADD). Example 2: A composition comprising polystyrene in majority () and polymethylmethacrylate () in minority.Search queries: (, ), and optionally  (ADD).#C8Lz search rules do not apply when polysiloxane is in majority and when there is a second polysiloxane,  is used as subsequent symbol(s) in that case.Example 3: A composition comprising epoxy functional polysiloxane () in majority and polydimethylsiloxane in minority ().Search queries: (, ).To search for a composition of three or more polymers, build search queries as follows: ( of the polymer in majority, an appropriate subgroup of  - ) and  (ADD)The search statement can also be further refined by searching the polymers in minority by using their  as ADD for documents classified between 2003 and April 2012.In the case of a composition of three or more polymers, the subsequent symbol is taken from the group of  -  that covers all minority polymers.Example 4: A composition comprising polystyrene in majority () and polyester (Polycaprolactone) () and polyamide (Nylon) () in minority.Search queries: (, ) and  (ADD), and optionally  (ADD) and  (ADD)Example 5: A composition comprising polystyrene in majority () and polyester (Polycaprolactone) () and natural rubber () in minority.Search queries: (, ) and  (ADD), and optionally  (ADD) and  (ADD)","C08F|C08G|D06|C08L|C08K|C08L|C08L1/00|C08L5/00|C08L89/00|C08L97/00|C08J3/075|C08J2300/00|C08J2399/00|C08L1/00|C08L5/00|C08L89/00|C08L97/00|C08B|C08L|C08J3/24|C08L2201/00|C08L2555/86|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L2666/00|C08L2666/86|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L|C08L|C08L|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C08L83/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08L|C08L|C08K|C08L|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08L|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K|C08L|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C08K|C08L83/00|C08L|C08L2666/00|C08L2666/26|C08L|C08L2666/00|C08L2666/26|C08L|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08K|C08L|C08K|C09D101/00|C09D201/10|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C09D|C08L|C09D101/00|C09D101/00|C09D201/10|C09D183/02|C09D183/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C09D|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C09D101/00|C09D183/02|C09D183/16|C08L83/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C09D183/02|C09D183/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C09D183/00|C09D101/00|C09D201/10|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09D|C08L|C08K|C09D101/00|C09D101/00|C09D201/10|C09D183/02|C09D183/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09D|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K|C09D101/00|C09D183/02|C09D183/16|C08L83/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09D183/02|C09D183/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C08K|C09D183/00|C09D101/00|C09D201/10|C08L2666/00|C08L2666/26|C09D|C08L2666/00|C08L2666/26|C09D101/00|C09J101/00|C09J201/10|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C09J|C08L|C09J101/00|C09J101/00|C09J201/10|C09J183/02|C09J183/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C09J|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C09J101/00|C09J183/02|C09J183/16|C08L83/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C09J183/02|C09J183/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C09J183/00|C09J101/00|C09J201/10|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09J|C08L|C08K|C09J101/00|C09J101/00|C09J201/10|C09J183/02|C09J183/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09J|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K|C09J101/00|C09J183/02|C09J183/16|C08L83/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09J183/02|C09J183/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C08K|C09J183/00|C09J101/00|C09J201/10|C08L2666/00|C08L2666/26|C09J|C08L2666/00|C08L2666/26|C09J101/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08L|C08L|C08K|C08L|C08K|C08K|C08L2201/00|C08L2555/86|C08L77/00|C08L67/00|C08L23/06|C08L2205/03|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08G77/02|C08G77/62|C08L9/00|C08L63/00|C08L9/00|C08L63/00|C08L9/00|C08L63/00|C08L9/00|C08L63/00|C08L63/00|C08L9/00|C08L67/02|C08L67/02|C08L69/00|C08L69/00|C08L77/06|C08L67/00|C08K7/02|C08K5/523|C08L77/06|C08L67/00|C08K7/02|C08K5/523|C08G77/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L1/00|C08L101/10|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08G77/02|C08G77/62|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L|C08K|C08L|C08K|C08G63/02|C08G77/26|C08G77/14|C08L67/02|C08L83/08|C08L83/00|C08G77/14|C08G77/26|C08G63/02|C08G77/26|C08G77/14|C08L67/02|C08L83/08|C08L83/00|C08K3/04|C08G77/14|C08G77/26|C08L83/00|C08L|C08L83/00|C09D|C09J|C09D|C09J|C08L|C08L2666/00|C08L2666/26|C08L2666/02|C08L2666/26|C08L|C08L25/06|C08L2666/18|C08L25/06|C08L2666/18|C08L67/04|C08L25/06|C08L2666/04|C08L25/06|C08L2666/04|C08L33/12|C08L83/00|C08L83/06|C08L83/00|C08L83/06|C08L83/00|C08L|C08L2666/02|C08L2666/26|C08L2205/03|C08L|C08L2666/00|C08L2666/26|C08L25/06|C08L2666/18|C08L2666/20|C08L25/06|C08L2666/14|C08L2205/03|C08L67/04|C08L77/06|C08L25/06|C08L2666/18|C08L2666/08|C08L25/06|C08L2666/02|C08L2205/03|C08L67/04|C08L7/00","Addition polymersPolymers in which unsaturated monomer molecules join together to form a polymer in which the molecular formula of the repeat unit is identical (except for the double bond) with that of the monomer.Aliphatic radical Means an acyclic or non-aromatic carbocyclic carbon skeleton which is considered to be terminated by every bond to: an element other than carbon; a carbon atom having a double bond to one atom other than carbon; an aromatic carbocyclic ring or a heterocyclic ring.
