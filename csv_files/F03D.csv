The ""augmenting"" guiding means are those guiding means which intercept an area of flow greater than this ""effective rotor area"", and direct the flow into the rotor. The guiding means which fulfil this intercepting role are bounded on all sides from inlet to outlet into rotor, and therefore also accelerate or ""concentrate"" the flow into the rotor.
