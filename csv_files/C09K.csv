In the case of Markush formulae, the inventive idea is classified. Further, an attempt is made to classify each exemplified embodiment.The general philosophy could be summarized as follows: - LC compounds or the LC mixtures characterised in general by the optical, electrical or physical properties of the components are classified in the subgroups  - . The two-dot subgroups  -  are non-hierarchical and each embodiment or example of a LC compound or mixture should be classified and may be placed in a different subgroup. - These subgroups cover LC compounds or the LC mixtures characterised in general by the chemical structure of the liquid crystal component, mainly the specific ring or rings or ring system(s) used, as well as the linking groups between the rings. -  These subgroups cover LC mixtures characterised in general by the chemical structure of the components, which are not liquid crystals, e.g. additives.In short every document may classifiedin one or more subgroups from  -  and/orin one or more subgroups from  -  and/orin one or more subgroups from  - . We place the LC embodiments in groups, where we expect to retrieve them accurately and efficiently during search. When in doubt, classify! What goes under a specific group is straightforward, since the title of the group is comprehensive.Next to the ECLA Scheme (based on the ring(s) of the LC molecules), a non-hierarchical Indexing Code has been developed to cater for cases, where a specific unit, a linking group, an end group, the positioning of a substituent, or a special bonding is the characterising part of the chemical structure of the liquid crystal component, instead of the ring or rings that constitute the LC molecule.That means that documents in various groups may get the same Indexing Code.Figuratively speaking, the Indexing Code ( -  ) cuts vertically the EC-Scheme.In other cases ( to end) the Indexing Code givesa more detailed view of the sequence of rings and linkers in a LC molecule ora more detailed list of the compounding ingredients.","C09K19/02|C09K19/603|C09K19/02|C09K19/0283|C09K19/02|C09K19/0283|C09K19/0208|C09K19/0283|C09K19/04|C09K19/50|C09K19/52|C09K19/603|C09K19/02|C09K19/0283|C09K19/04|C09K19/50|C09K19/52|C09K19/603|C09K19/04|C09K2019/0496|C09K19/06","","This place covers: Liquid crystal (LC) compounds (non-polymeric, as well as polymeric), mixtures of liquid crystal compounds, and mixtures of liquid crystal compounds with additives that are NOT liquid crystal compounds (solvents, solid particles, macromolecular compounds, aligning agents, dopants, charge transfer agents, surfactants, pleochroic dyes)."
