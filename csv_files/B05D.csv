A coating may be a solidified layer originally applied as a liquid (e.g. dried paint) or a layer of material which, once applied, remains in a liquid or semi-liquid state (e.g. lubricant).FlockingThe deposition of fibre particles ('flock') upon a surface where the particles land non-parallel to the surface. The process may be facilitated by the application of electrostatic charge to the flock to cause its attraction to an adhesive-coated surface ('electrostatic flocking'). This results in the fibres standing perpendicular to the surface.Fluidised-bed techniqueA technique used to cause dry particulate material to behave like a fluid. This is commonly achieved by the introduction of a pressurised fluid into the material and promotes a high degree of contact between the fluid and material.Liquid or fluentdesignates materials which can flow, e.g. liquids, including solutions, dispersions and suspensions, as well as semi-liquids, pastes, melts and particulate materials.Particulate materialsSolid materials in the form of very small pieces, e.g. powders, granules, short fibres or chips.Langmuir-Blodgett films (LB)Contains one or more monolayers of an organic material, deposited from the surface of a liquid onto a solid by immersing (emersing) the solid substrate into (or from) the liquid, the layer being compressed before depositionSAMSelf assembled monolayers that are formed spontaneously by adsorption of amphifunctional molecules at solid-liquid and solid-gas interfaces, forming organised molecular assemblies","This place covers: Processes for coating substrates in general only.
