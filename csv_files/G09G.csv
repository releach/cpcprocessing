The voltages set on the columns correspond to the pixel values in the row being addressed. This scheme leads to very low voltage selection ratios and, consequently, low contrast. In the Active Adressing scheme, several rows are addressed simultaneously in different patterns corresponding to orthogonal functions. A set of functions is orthogonal over a certain interval if the integral of the product of any two of the functions is 0 if the functions are different, and a constant if they are the same function. From signal processing theory, we can represent a given signal as a sum of differing amounts of these orthogonal functions. If we suppose the signal we wish to represent is the sequence of pixel values in a particular column of a display, then we can create that signal by applying the correct orthogonal functions to the row lines and certain voltages on the column line that correspond to the amounts of those functions we want. If we use the same functions to represent the signals in the other columns, then we can create a whole display by applying the correct voltages to all of the column lines in parallel."

Although some of the driving voltages may possibly be coincident with the power supply voltages (normally the extreme voltage values), driving voltages serve the purpose of composing an electrode addressing waveform, rather than supplying power to a functional unit; driving voltages may be representative of gradation levels (AM gradations) or may merely be levels required by a complex waveform (e.g. in the addressing of passive matrix LCDs, FLCDs, electrophoretic panels etc). The lines/electrodes to which driving voltages are applied may or may not draw power from the generating circuit; driving voltages may normally be regarded as reference voltages, and normally for them only very small fluctuations are tolerated. The generation of voltages is different than the generation of signals applied to the electrodes. Illustrative examples: US2007046600 (Generation, by means of an arrangement of resistor ladders and selectors of voltages corresponding to gradation levels for an active matrix LCD, that take into account also the required gamma correction; the generated voltages are then selectively applied to the signal lines by the corresponding driver) US2008007502 (Charge pumps are used to generated voltage levels used for driving an LCD; not necessarily corresponding to the power supply level of the circuitry, possibly higher) WO9100588 (Generation by means of arrangements of resistor ladders, buffers etc., of voltages used in the composition of (possibly) complex waveforms driving rows and columns in a passive LCD)"

The receiver generates a clock from an approximate frequency reference, and then phase-aligns to the transitions in the data stream with a phase-locked loop (PLL). This process is commonly known as clock and data recovery (CDR). In order for this scheme to work, a data stream must transition frequently enough to correct for any drift in the PLL's oscillator. The limit for how long a clock recovery unit can operate without a transition is known as its maximum consecutive identical digits (CID) specification. To ensure frequent transitions, some sort of encoding is used; 8B/10B encoding is very common, while Manchester encoding serves the same purpose."
