CPC title will be updated/corrected once this inconsistency is resolved in IPC.Patent and non-patent documents describing the growth of single crystals/homogenous polycrystalline material with defined structure are classified according to the method/apparatus used and the chemical and physical nature of the grown crystal.Patent documents often list whole series of materials which can be grown as crystals. The classifier should provide the appropriate classification symbol under  for those materials grown as crystals in the examples and any mentioned in the claims. Where a whole series is mentioned without emphasis on one particular material, for example GaAs, GaInAs, InAs, GaAlAs, GaN, InN, AlN etc., the classifier should try to identify the most appropriate classification(s) covering the families of materials mentioned. In this case  and  would be appropriate and suffcient.Mere references to ""crystals"" or ""single crystals"" in a document in the absence of other details do not lead to a classification in . For example a reference to a ""Czochkralski grown silicon single crystal"" in the description of a substrate used for a semiconductor device is not sufficient for requiring a classification in . If, however, the reference includes further details about the chemical/physical properties of the crystal and these do not seem trivial then the classifier should give the appropriate  classification. Documents referring to the synthesis of chemical compounds which also mention crystallographic results for the solid are not normally classified in  unless there is emphasis on the crystal growing technique.Concerning the circulation of documents to other fields by giving symbols of the other fields, most patents concerning crystal growth mention to different degrees of emphasis the applications where the grown crystal are to be used. Where there is a specific reference to a particular device or application using the crystal then the document should be circulated to that field. For example, a document mentioning the fabrication of a particular type of transistor using the grown crystal, then the document should be circulated to the semiconductor field ().Concerning vapour phase epitaxial growth apparatus, the search should always consult the relevant groups in  where such apparatuses are also classified. Epitaxial growth is dependent primarily on process parameters and substrate, an apparatus used for ""epitaxial growth"" in the overwhelming majority of cases the same apparatus can be used for providing non-epitaxial coatings. Documents concerning apparatus features in these processes should also be classified in  and .","B29|C30B|C30B29/00|C30B29/40|C30B29/403|C30B|C30B|C30B|C30B|H01L|C23C|C23C14/00|C23C16/00","AmorphousDescription of a solid material not having long-range crystalline lattice structure.CrystalDescription of a solid material having long-range order of atoms or molecules arranged in a regularly-repeating lattice structure.Defined structureThe structure of a solid material with grains which are oriented in a preferential way or have larger dimensions than normally obtained.EpitaxyThe formation of a crystalline layer on a substrate in such a manner that the formed crystal bears a definite crystallographic relationship to the substrate.EutecticDescription of a mixture or solution containing two or more phases at a composition that has the lowest melting point and where the phases simultaneously crystallize from solution at this temperature.Homogeneous polycrystalline materialA solid material with crystal particles, all of which have the same chemical composition.LatticeAn ordered arrangement of atoms or molecules within a solid material.Oriented crystalline materialA polycrystalline structure in which the grains are generally aligned in a preferential direction such as obtained in columnar growth.SeedA material, usually itself a small single-crystal, upon which a single-crystal is grown, the seeded crystal growth proceeding by the alignment of atoms or molecules or clusters into a thermodynamically favored arrangement determined by the nature of the seed.Single-crystalDescription of a solid material having at least one long-range order of atoms or molecules in a regularly-repeating lattice structure throughout the body of material. Also includes twin crystals and a predominantly single crystal product.Superlattice A single-crystal having an internal structure of more than two layers, each layer having a composition different from the next adjacent layer.Twin crystalA crystalline material in which the adjoining crystalline lattices have a mirror-image symmetrical relationship, the interface between the adjoining crystals being termed the twin plane.Zone meltingDescription of a process in which a crystallized body is formed by melting a zone of a starting material with subsequent cooling and crystallisation while either the zone or the starting product is displaced so that all or part of the starting material is converted into the crystallized body.Grains Crystalline regions in a solid material, each grain generally being a single crystalline region.Whiskers/needles Discrete solid crystalline particles of generally elongated shape. Dimensions are superior to 100 nm and are not considered as nanocrystals (nanowires, nanorods etc.)Bulk/layerBulk crystals have dimensions which are comparable in all three dimensions whereas layers have one dimension (thickness) significantly less then the other two dimensions (surface area). For thick layers the distinction may not be always evident and a certain degree of double classification is unavoidable. Often a bulk layer is grown from a discrete ""seed"" whereas a layer is grown epitaxially on a substrate. NanocrystalsSingle crystals having at least one dimension less than 100 nm. The term includes nanowires, nanotubes, nanorods etc.","This place covers: Single crystals or homogeneous polycrystalline material with a defined structure; production thereof.
