Diagnosis consists of scrutinizing scrutinising the following characteristics or aspects of bodies: internal or external portions of the bodies (e.g. lungs), abnormal bodily conditions (e.g. sickness, broken bones, detecting foreign bodies, pregnancy), mental conditions (e.g. psychotechniques), and bodily functions (e.g. heart beat, vision).
