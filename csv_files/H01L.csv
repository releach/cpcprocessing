Electrodes are often referred to as ""contacts"" in the literature. An electrode may include several portions and the term includes metallic regions which exert influence on the solid state body through an insulating region, (e.g. capacitive coupling) and inductive coupling arrangements to the body. The dielectric region in a capacitive arrangement is regarded as part of the electrode. In arrangements including several portions only those portions which exert an influence on the solid state body by virtue of their shape, size or disposition or the material of which they are formed are considered to be part of the electrode. The other portions are considered to be ""arrangements for conducting electric current to or from the solid state body"" or ""interconnections between solid state components formed in or on a common substrate"", e.g. interconnections.EncapsulationAn ""encapsulation"" is an enclosure which consists of one or more layers formed on the body and in intimate contact therewith.Integrated CircuitAn ""integrated circuit"" is a device where all components, e.g. diodes, resistors, are built up on a common substrate and form the device including interconnections between the components.Integration ProcessProcesses for the manufacture of at least two different components where the process is especially adapted to their integration, e.g. to take advantage of the integration or to reduce their manufacturing cost. Example: in a CMOS process, the same ion implant dopes the p-MOS gate and the n-MOS source and drain. Consequently, a process for the manufacture of a component per se is not considered as an integration process, even though that component will be part of an integrated circuit.Interconnection Refers to the arrangement of conductive and insulating regions aimed at electrically connecting the respective electrodes of at least two device units, e.g. two transistors. PartsThe term ""parts"" includes all structural units which are included in a complete ""device"".Solid State BodyThe expression ""solid state body"" refers to the body of material within which, or at the surface of which, the physical effects characteristic of the device occur. In thermoelectric devices it includes all materials in the current path.WaferA ""wafer"" means a slice of semiconductor or crystalline substrate material, which can be modified by impurity diffusion (doping), ion implantation or epitaxy, and whose active surface can be processed into arrays of discrete devices or integrated circuits.","This place covers: in general discrete and integrated semiconductor devices and other electric solid state devices (as far as not provided for in another subclass) and details thereof. This includes the following kind of devices: integrated circuit devices, e.g. CMOS integrated devices, DRAM, EPROM, CCD; semiconductor devices (e.g. field-effect, bipolar) adapted for rectifying, amplifying, oscillating or switching, e.g. diodes, transistors, thyristors; semiconductor devices sensitive to radiation, e.g. photo diodes, photo transistors, solar cells; incoherent light emitting diodes, e.g. LED; solid state devices using organic materials as the active part or using a combination of organic materials with other materials as the active part, e.g. organic LED or polymer LED; electric solid state devices using thermoelectric, superconductive, piezo-electric, electrostrictive, magnetostrictive, galvano-magnetic or bulk negative resistance effects, e.g. thermo couples, Peltier elements, Josephson elements, piezo elements; photo-resistors, magnetic field dependent resistors, field effect resistors; capacitors with potential-jump barrier, resistors with potential-jump barrier or surface barrier; thin-film or thick-film circuits; processes and apparatus adapted for the manufacture or treatment of such devices, except where such processes relate to single step processes for which provision exists elsewhere."
