There are further main groups which are dedicated to one or more specific types of memory cell technologies. Within these, there may be specific sub-groups for aspects such as power supply or addressing which parallel the general groups. The convention is that, where a document describes a specific aspect for a specific cell technology without indicating its use with other cell types, it should only be classified under the technology group. If it is described as applicable to two cell types then it should be classified under each cell type and in the general group. Thus, for example, a sense amplifier for a resistive RAM would be classified under , while a document applying the same sense amplifier to both ReRAM and flash memory would be further classified in  and . is a further general group covering the aspects of testing and repair of memory devices.
