Additional information found in the claims and in the description and figures, which might be relevant for future searches is given an Indexing Code symbol.Main groups ,  and subgroups -:Classification proceeds by assigning the most restricted possible CPC symbol to the document, followed by additional knowledge tagging using Indexing Code symbols. This implies that CPC head subgroups (corresponding to IPC subgroups) should only be used if no other possibility could be found for classifying the document in a more restricted subgroup.If the set of claims comprises product or article and method claims an CPC symbol should be assigned to each of these categories. However if the most suitable subgroup for a claim of a given category, e.g. product, does not exist in the main group of the same category, e.g. product group, and can only be found in groups of another corresponding category, e.g. a group for a method to manufacture the product, this latter subgroup should be assigned to the claim e.g. method subgroup assigned to a product claim. For example a document with no method claims dealing with a magnetic tunnel junction in which the spacer has been processed in such a way that its material structure becomes inventive, would still be given the method CPC symbol  as product CPC symbol  is silent over any material inventive features.Another use of Indexing Codes can be made for particular cases where the invention is a specific property of a given type of material or article and this property is classified only in subgroups of another specific material type. In this case the corresponding CPC symbol cannot be given. Consequently the Indexing Code should be given together with an CPC symbol corresponding to the material described in the document. For example: a sintered nanocomposite exchange spring magnet of SmCo/Fe cannot be given  as CPC symbol since the latter symbol belongs to NdFeB magnets classification subtree. Therefore the combination  and  should be used.","H01F1/00|H01F10/00|H01F41/14|H01F41/34|H01F41/307|H01F10/3254|H01F1/0579|H01F1/0557|H01F1/0579","Compoundhomogenous substance comprising at least two elements, having a non-metallic character and a specific (fixed) composition ratio, including also intermetallic compounds.","This place covers: Magnets or magnetic bodies characterised by the magnetic materials therefor.
