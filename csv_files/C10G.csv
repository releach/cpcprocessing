The term is usually used of a natural resource that is almost in a usable form, but which is more useful in a purer form. For instance, most types of natural petroleum will burn straight from the ground, but they will burn poorly and quickly clog an engine with residues and byproducts. the Term ""refining"" is broad and may include more drastic transformations. the refining of liquids is often accomplished by distillation or fractionation.Reforming (catalytic)Thermal or catalytic reforming is a chemical process used to convert naphtha boiling range feedstocks, typically having low octane ratings, into high-octane liquid products called reformates which are components of high-octane gasoline (also known as petrol). The process represents the total effect of numerous simultaneous reactions, such as dehydrogenation, isomerisation, cracking and polymerisation.Destructive hydrogenationSplitting of molecules of the raw material with addition of hydrogen to them, also called direct liquefaction, liquefaction of coal by reacting it with hydrogen at high temperature and pressureVoltolisingSubjecting oils to treatment with an electric discharge.","This place covers: Production of liquid hydrocarbon mixtures from oil-shale, oil-sand or non-melting solid carbonaceous materials (e.g. wood, coal), from oxides of carbon (e.g. Fischer-Tropsch processes), from oxygen-containing organic materials (e.g. fatty acids or fatty oils) or from gases (e.g. natural gas).
