Fluorescent activity is a short term or rapid emission response, unlike phosphorescence, which is a delayed emission. These additives are often used to enhance the appearance of colour of fabric and paper, causing a ""whitening"" effect, making materials look less yellow by increasing the overall amount of blue light reflected. FLUORESCENT BRIGHTENING AGENTS are colourless  fluorescent dyes. They are also called OPTICAL BRIGHTENERS. In accordance with their definition as ""colourless"" fluorescent dyes, Their colouristic performance is that of fluorescent dyes, without absorbing light in the visible range of the spectrum. They absorb ultraviolet rays present in incident sunlight. This absorbed ultraviolet light is re-emitted by the FLUORESCENT BRIGHTENING AGENT, which is of longer wavelength than the incident ultraviolet light and is known as the fluorescence light. This generally falls in the blue region of the visible spectra. The fluorescence light is then superimposed on the reflected light thereby restoring the balance of different colours and hence producing brilliant white effect.Differential optical brighteningProcess to optically brighten fibres which are of the same basic type, e.g. nylon, but with different optical brightening properties.","This place covers: Dry-cleaning or industrial washing of fibres, filaments, threads, yarns, fabrics, feathers, or made-up fibrous goods using organic, inorganic or aqueous baths. Processes include desizing or chemical preparation for subsequent chemical treatments like dyeing or the application of finishing agents. Furthermore, it includes the regeneration of used chemical baths, working under pressure in closed vessels, processes combined with mechanical means, and multi-step processes. Bleaching fibres, filaments, threads, yarns, fabrics, feathers, or made-up fibrous goods, leather, or furs using, for example, reducing agents, enzymes, irradiation, ozonisation or optical bleaching and compounds which develop oxygen or which contain halogen."
