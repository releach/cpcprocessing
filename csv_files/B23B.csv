The use of Indexing Codes from the 200-series is widespread in the subclass and these Indexing Codes should be allocated at every opportunity. When classifying, the Indexing Codes relating to a particular group or subgroup should be consulted and allocated if appropriate, taking precedence over similar Indexing Codes present within the whole subclass. For example, if classifying in  or subgroups, the Indexing Codes relating to the details of collet chucks should be consulted and allocated to provide additional information.

Where the allocation of Indexing Code-codes is mandatory (most notably within the subgroups containing cutting inserts,  and ), this is indicated in the templates for the main-group at the sub-group level.In the Indexing Code system the term ""discontinuous"" is used to mean containing points or lines of inflection or gaps.Pictorial examples of the content of the most widely used subgroups have been provided within this FCR.

The method must be related to the drilling or boring operation per se. The term ""drilling"" is intended to mean the removal of material by the rotation of a tool relative to a workpiece with the primary purpose of the efficient removal of material. In drilling to tool generally has an elongated cutting edge. The term ""boring"" is intended to mean the machining of an existing hole by a relative helical movement of one or more single point cutting tools with respect to the workpiece in order to either improve the surface finish of the hole or to more precisely establish the centre of the hole. A boring operation may thus remove more material from one side of a hole than from the opposite side, whereas in a drilling operation the same amount of material is removed from each side of the axis of the tool.
