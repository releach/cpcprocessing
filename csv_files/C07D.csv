The processes of preparation are also classified in the groups for the types of reaction employed, if of interest. The compounds prepared are also classified in the groups for the types of compounds prepared, if of interest.Salts of a compound, unless specifically provided for, are classified as that compound. Salts, adducts or complexes formed between two or more organic compounds are classified according to all compounds forming the salts, adducts or complexes.Where a molecule may exist in tautomeric forms, classification is made for the form which appears latest in the scheme. Therefore, double bonds between ring members and non-ring members and double bonds between ring members themselves are considered equivalent in determining the degree of hydrogenation of the ring.Compounds containing a single heterocycle are classified in the range - (cf. Table 1). Compounds containing two or more heterocycles, none of which are condensed among themselves nor condensed with a carbocyclic ring, and all of which are covered by the same main group, are also classified in this range.Compounds containing two or more hetero rings individually covered by different main groups, and not part of the same condensed ring system are classified in the range - (cf. Table 2).Compounds containing two or more hetero rings, being part of the same condensed ring system, are classified in the range - (cf. Table 3 and 4).Heterocyclic compounds which contain rings of five or more members, wherein only nitrogen is present as a ring heteroatom, and wherein the ring carbon atoms are fully saturated and only bound to hydrogen atoms, are classified in main group . Morpholines and thiomorpholines unsubstituted on the ring carbon atoms are also classified here.An acyclic side-chain linked to the hetero ring is considered to be terminated by every bond to: 1) an element other than carbon 2) a carbon atom having three bonds to hetero atoms, with at the most one bond to halogen, e.g. ester or nitrile radicals. For example, the compound:  is classified in  and not in Where a heterocycle is linked to a carbocycle by an acyclic chain, and both the chain and the carbocycle are further substituted by either hetero atoms or carbon atoms with three bonds to hetero atoms, not more than one hetero atom being a halogen, the molecule is classified according to the substituents on the acyclic chain. See the following example:is classified in group , and the compound is classified in groups  and , where X = - NH2, - NHCOCH3, or - COOCH3.- cover compounds containing one system of two or more relevant hetero rings condensed among themselves or condensed with a common carbocyclic ring system, with or without other non- condensed hetero rings. For the purpose of classification in groups -, the degree of hydrogenation of the ring system is not taken into consideration. For the purpose of classification in groups , , -, , -, the wording of the groups has to be understood, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, as including ring systems further condensed with carbocyclic rings or ring systems, but excluding ring systems further condensed with other hetero rings, either directly or through a common carbocyclic ring system, e.g. sparteine is classified in group , not in group . In groups , , - or -, the subdivision is based on the number of relevant hetero rings.Where a compound contains at least one ring covered by group  and at least one other hetero ring, the hetero ring covered by group  is treated as an acyclic chain containing nitrogen atoms for the purposes of classification and is not considered to be a hetero ring in this context.Thus, e.g. , and NOT  and, and NOT , and NOT What is classified as a compound?Classified are real examples of claimed compounds, i.e. those which are prepared or for which physical data are given, and which are individually named or drawn in the claims. The same applies for compounds disclosed as reaction intermediates.Not classified are generic formulae (Markush formulae, even if they have only one variable group), lists of ""prophetic compounds"" which fall within the scope of the claims but which were not actually prepared and compounds disclosed in the description but which are not claimed as compounds per se.What is classified as a process for the preparation of a compound?Classified are only preparation examples of claimed processes. A process is classified in a process group if a dedicated process group exists (e.g.  or ). Where there is no process group for making a particular compound the process is classified according to the product obtained in the claimed process.Further classification information:Tables 1-4 provide an overview of the main groups in .Structural chemical formulae for various subgroups (in particular for specific ring systems as shown in table 3 below) are available in the classification scheme on the WIPO web-site.Table 1: Overview of main groups  - : Number of heteroatoms / Number of carbon atoms / Ring characteristicsOnly N:  Preparation of unsubstituted lactams1N / 2C / _1N / 3C / _1N / 4C / __ / _ / condensed pyrroles1N / 5C / hydrogenated1N / 5C / aromatic  _ / _ / quinolines_ / _ / isoquinolines_ / _ / acridines_ / _ / other condensed pyridines1N / 6C / _1N / > 6C / _Heterocyclic compounds according to more than one of groups - 2N / 1C,2C / _2N / 3C / (1,2)2N / 3C / (1,3)_ / _ / condensed imidazoles2N / 4C / (1,2)2N / 4C / (1,3)2N / 4C / (1,4)2N / 5C / _2N / > 5C / _Heterocyclic compounds according to more than one of groups - 3N / 2C / (1,2,3)3N / 3C / (1,3,5)3N / 3C / (1,2,4), (1,2,3)3N / _ /  - 4N / _ / _> 4N / _ / _ Only N+O:1N+1O / 3C / (1,2)1N+1O / 3C / (1,3)1N+1O / 4C / _ 1N+1O / >4C / _ Heterocyclic compounds according to more than one of groups - 2N+1O / 2C / _ N+O / _ /  -  Only N+S: 1N+1S / 3C / (1,2)1N+1S / 3C / (1,3)1N+1S / 4C / _1N+1S / >4C / _Heterocyclic compounds according to more than one of groups - N+S/ _ / ≠ 275-283 Only N+O+S:N+Se/Te(+O) (+S)N+O+S / _ / _ N+Se/Te(+O) (+S) / _ / _ compounds containing polymethylene-imine rings with at least five ring members, 3-azabicyclo [3.2.2] nonane, piperazine, morpholine or thiomorpholine rings, having only hydrogen atoms directly attached to the ring carbon atoms Only O;
