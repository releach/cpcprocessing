Gathering covers as well associating and registering flat or folded sheets to a single copy of a publication, e.g. for subsequent stapling. Collating covers as well examining the associated section or set of sections, after gathering but before attaching, for proper sequence, e.g. by examining step marks on the back of the folded sheets.
