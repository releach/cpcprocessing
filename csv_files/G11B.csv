Although these areas are fairly self-contained, there are some overlapping definitions which may lead to unnecessary dual classification. Obviously, however, it may often be necessary to classify documents across several areas (method, apparatus, carrier) if a document contains matter which is interesting from several points of view.The rules of classification below point out specific examples of places where dual classification should be avoided.General note: for reasons obvious to those who work in the field, the majority of documents in  now relate to magnetic disk drives, specifically hard disks, although a significant minority relate to tape systems, which are still widely used in e.g. large-scale data backup. Magnetic drums represent an older technology which has largely disappeared. Magnetic cards (e.g. ATM cards, 'swipe' cards) are also represented, but there is much overlap with areas of  (see 'Informative references' above). This is reflected in the structure of much of , which refers explicitly to aspects of disk drives.Because of this situation, the following general rules apply:Documents relating to the 'minority' carriers, e.g. tapes, webs, wires, cards, drums, are always classified in one of the subgroups concerning methods and apparatuses for a specific carrier form (, ).However, the 'record carrier' subgroups ( and the subgroups which depend upon it) are only used if there is something interesting about the carrier itself (other than the materials of which it is made, for which see  et seq.) e.g. a disk has a series of timing slots or holes in it, or a drum is made removable by separating into two halves longitudinally, etc.If an aspect (e.g. head, method of recording, servo tracking, etc.) is of more general application, or if there is a place more specific to it elsewhere in the scheme (e.g.  is specifically for track following on tapes), it is also classified there. partially overlaps with , , .
