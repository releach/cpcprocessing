Such features can be found, for example, in the figures depicting the embodiments and in the corresponding discussion of these figures in the description. Classification in  is not restricted to the wording of the claims or the summary of the invention. Even a detailed prior art device discussed into detail in the disclosure may be classified correspondingly.In  it should be carefully distinguished between defining (e.g.  or ), controlling (e.g.  or -) and stabilising (e.g.  or ). This is illustrated with the following example: A grating as one end mirror of the cavity of a laser defines and therefore fixes the wavelength of the laser. As long as it is not disclosed that this grating is intentionally rotated, such a grating will be classified as being a part of the resonator only, e.g. in  or in . As soon as it is disclosed, that the grating is rotated to tune the wavelength, this is considered to fall under a wavelength control by a grating which is classified in , for example. When finally a feed-back loop is disclosed, e.g. with the help of a wavelength sensitive detector the intensity at a given wavelength is monitored and kept stable with the help of the feed-back loop, then a group in  will be allocated. As however in the  and sub-groups the nature of the wavelength defining reflector is not included, further classes in  and sub-groups should be used to characterize the resonator details, e.g. the reflector being a grating and the number of resonator mirrors present.This subclass does not cover light emitting devices where it is merely stated that they are a laser or maser, i.e. where the laser or maser is simply a ""black box"" without any specific details on the electromagnetic wave generation or feedback on it.","H01S|H01S|H01S|H01S3/08|H01S5/10|H01S3/10|H01S5/06|H01S5/065|H01S3/13|H01S5/068|H01S3/08009|H01S5/141|H01S3/1055|H01S3/139|H01S3/139|H01S3/08","active mediumA medium providing for optical gain by the stimulated emission effect when excited by an excitation (pump) energy source.laserIt is the acronym for ""light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation"" but it also refers, in broader sense, to any device using stimulated emission of radiation by excited atoms.Hence, for example, the expressions ""semiconductor laser"", ""dye laser"", ""optical fibre laser"" or ""X-ray laser"".pumpingThe process of providing the active medium for excitation energy.","This place covers: Devices using stimulated emission, for the generation or amplification of coherent electromagnetic waves or other forms of wave energy, e.g. masers, lasers, X-ray lasers, gamma lasers, optical amplifiers.
