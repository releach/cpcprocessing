In case the classification does not contain a group corresponding to the technical problem, the classifier should allocate either a residual group (see below), or in exceptional cases, when appropriate, several groups that in conjunction describe the technical problem.As the invention may comprise several essential technical features, a document classified in  may be allocated more than one Indexing Code. The Indexing Codes which are allocated should be relevant to the invention.Furthermore, the Indexing Codes must only be allocated to documents which are receiving a main groupResidual GroupsThe classification in  contains so called residual groups. For example: . . . Processes for integrating an electronic processing unit with a micromechanical structure not provided for in  - When classifying a document which doesn't correspond to any subgroup (for example  - ), the document must be classified in the residual group, if present, and not in the main group. In the present example, the documents should be classified in  and not in .The classifier must stick to this policy: no new document should be classified in a main group if a residual group is present.The reason for these residual groups is to provide the search examiner with the certainty, that all documents in the groups have been classified or reclassified. If a residual group is not present, but subgroups are, the examiner has no certainty that the documents from the main group have been reclassified when creating the subgroups.When doing the search, the presence of the residual group indicates that all documents in the residual group have been classified taking into account the subgroups of the same level. Documents in the group of higher level, which have been split up into the sub-groups, may not have been classified taking into account the sub-groups.Therefore, at search stage, the examiner must keep in mind that he must verify if documents are present in the main group, since these documents have not been reclassified.The classification structure in The classification in , based on IPC8, makes the difference between structures and processes. In many cases, the underlying problems, which form the basis for the technical definition of a group, are solved either with a structural solution, or with a manufacturing process. Therefore, some group descriptors are duplicated in  (Structures) and in  (Processes).The criteria for deciding if a document is to be classified in the structures or in the process is the following:if the solution to the technical problem is a structure, then the document should be classified in if the solution to the technical problem is a method, then the document belongs to Example: . Arrangements for avoiding sticking of the flexible or moving parts and . Treatments or methods for avoiding stiction of flexible or moving parts of MEMSIf for example, a document describes a process using supercritical CO for avoiding stiction, then it should be classified in .If the document describes a bump for avoiding stiction of a cantilever, then it should be classified in .Exceptions: contains also the processes for making anti-stiction coatings","B81C|B81C1/00|B81C99/00|B81B2201/00|B81B2207/99|B81C2201/00|B81C2900/00|B81C|B81C|B81C|B81C1/00253|B81C1/0023|B81C1/00246|B81C1/0023|B81C1/00246|B81C1/00253|B81C1/00222|B81|B81|B81B|B81C|B81B|B81C|B81B3/0002|B81C1/00912|B81C1/00928|B81B3/001|B81B3/0005","Extending structures Pillar / ColumnTipDepressed structures Cavity GrooveHoleStictionUnintended adhesion of a moving part to another partSuspended structuresBridge Cantilever Diaphragm See-saw Comb structure Extending structures AnchorRibDepressed structures ChannelNozzleSuspended structures Flexure Membrane Spring Torsion hingeProof massRotating elements Gears Rack and pinionHingePillar/Column A tall vertical structure, usually narrow in proportion to its height, which is usually used as a support structure, anti-adhesion structure or a structure for thermal exchange. Tip Tips are small pointed or rounded structures often used for Scanning Probe Microscopy probes (SPM) - like atomic force microscope (AFM), but also for data storage (Millipede), electron tunnelling tip (used in sensors) or microneedles.BumpIt is a raised structure similar to a tip. It is generally used to describe the raised structures used for avoiding stiction of movable parts. It is also used in relation to structures for reducing adhesion.Functional layersFunctional layers are used mostly as protective coatings. They can protect structures against chemical or mechanical corrosion that can release particles into the protected cavity. Special coatings are used also to prevent adhesion of movable structures or to reduce the stress. Metallic layers covering polymer sealing are used to make them hermetic, but can be used also to compensate the RF-interferences.Anchor  Anchors are structures connecting the suspended movable parts to the substrate. They can affect the resonant frequency and the reliability of the device. Figure 2 : Anchor (US2005032266) RibStiffening ribs are may be used to improve the stiffness of suspended structures. Improving the stiffness to mass ratio, they can have impact on resonant frequency and efficiency of the devices.Cavity  In bulk micromachining, cavity is used to make the movement of a suspended element possible. It can be used also for the protection of movable structures in packaging, for thermal insulation or as a container for fluids (see Figure 1). The synonyms are chamber, hollow, well.Groove  A typical example is a V-Groove (see Figure 1), which can be formed in 100 - Si substrate by KOH etching. Sometimes the groove in 111 - Si substrate is called channel or trench to distinguish them, but we consider channel to be a function oriented definition. Grooves are usually used in microfluidic applications, but can also be used for precise positioning of optical fibres or controlled weakening of structures holding a device prior to its separation by breaking.Hole  An aperture passing through anything, a perforation, opening. Channel  A tube or tubular passage, natural or artificial, usually for liquids or fluids. Nozzle A spout, mouthpiece, projecting aperture, or a short terminal pipe from which a jet of gas or liquid may issue or be discharged (see Figure 1).Bridge A bridge is a structure, erected or suspended over a surface, depression or an obstruction, connecting two or more extremities, including structures with supports deformable in torsion (see Figure 4), flexion or supported by springs (see Figure 5 ). Figure 3 : Bridge (flow sensor: US6626037) Figure 4 : Bridge with torsion hinges (accelerometer: EP1431240) Figure 5 : Bridge with springs (inertial sensor: DE10118340) Application : thermal insulation for flow sensors, infra-red sensors, bolometers. According to this definition, most of the accelerometers, gyroscopes and micromirrors are bridgesCantilever  A cantilever is a structure which projects beyond a supporting column on a wall and is counterbalanced and/or supported at only one end. Cantilevers are also called flexures, suspension or cantilever beams and suspension springs if their structure is more complicated. These elements usually store and release mechanical energy by deformation resulting in vibration. A proof mass can be attached to one extremity of a cantilever. If there is a cantilever on both sides of a supported structure (proof mass or a micromirror), this structure is called a bridge. Figure 6: Cantilever/flexure with proof mass (accelerometer: EP1431240) Figure 7 : Cantilever (microvalve: EP1496269) Application: switches, resonators, chemical and biological sensors, accelerometersDiaphragm  A diaphragm is a layer covering a hole or a cavity, fixed to a frame all along its periphery, separating two environments. This separation can be hermetic or not, permanent or temporal and its opening can be controllable. Diaphragms can be perforated or have a seismic mass attached to it. Figure 8 : Diaphragm (micropump: FR2862629) Applications: pressure sensors, microphones, ultra-sound resonators, valves, accelerometers, thermal insulationSee-saw  See-saw structures are suspended structures supported by a flexible element which main axis is usually perpendicular to the substrate plane. These structures can be used as a support for micromirrors, switches, gyroscopes and resonators. Figure 9: See-saw (EP1306348)Comb structure, comb drive ,  A comb is a structure with a pair of comb-shaped electrodes. This shape increases the total capacitor surface. Comb structures are used for actuation or sensing. When voltage is applied, the combs are attracted to each-other. They are often attached to a deformable element that pulls them back to the initial position because they can not develop a repulsive force. Figure 10 : Comb structure (EP1868024) Flexure Flexure or a flexure beam is a structural element that carries load primarily in bending. Deformation comprises bending about an axis normal to the beam's axis. This allows the structures to move along the perpendicular axis to the substrate (see Figure 6).Membrane A membrane is a thin layer separating two environments allowing selective mass transport control, like chemical or physical filtering or separation of substances. Membrane is often used as synonym to diaphragm.Spring Spring is a suitably shaped structure that can return to its original shape after a deformation (see Figure 5). Torsion hinge Torsion hinge also called deformation hinge or a torsion beam is an element that deforms by twisting about an axis parallel to the beam's axis. This allows the structures to rotate around the axis parallel to the substrate (see Figure 4).Proof massProof mass also called seismic mass is a structural element usually connected to a deformable element. The mass of this element defines the resonant frequency, sensitivity and precision of the system. In some cases, holes or grooves are made on the proof mass to control or eliminate damping (see Figure 6).Gears A gear is a toothed wheel designed to transmit torque to another gear or toothed component.Rack and pinionStructure used to transform rotation to translation movement.Hinge The movable joint or mechanism to provide for the turning of two movable parts. Figure 11: Hinge Interconnects Electrically conducting element for transmitting a signal from one point to another one. Interconnects that may be formed on, in or through the substrate or any element formed on the substrate (e.g. lid of a package). A via is a particular form of an interconnect. Electrodes Electrically conducting element through which an electric current enters or leaves a substance (or a vacuum) whose electrical characteristics are being measured, used, or manipulated. Also terminal points in electrical components. Thermal actuators  The movement is generated by the difference in thermal expansion of two of more elements (generally beams), each elements having at least one anchoring point to the substrate. A typical thermal actuator is formed out of two parallel beams (one cold beam and one thermal beam) attached at one end to the substrate and having one connecting point at the other end. When the temperature of the thermal beam becomes higher than the temperature of the cold beam, the difference of thermal expansion generates a deflection at the connecting point. Figure 12 : Thermal beam (US2003002133) Search and Classification Notes:Thermal actuators are also found in  . Bimorph and unimorph actuators  A bimorph is a cantilever that consists of two active layers. These layers produce a displacement via: Thermal activation (a temperature change causes one layer to expand more than the other). Electrical activation as in a piezoelectric bimorph (electric field(s) cause one layer to extend and the other layer to contract). A piezoelectric unimorph has one active (i.e. piezoelectric) layer and one inactive (i.e. non-piezoelectric) layer. For example in the following figure, in response to application of a voltage to the first movable electrode 25, the second movable electrode 26, and the third movable electrode 27, the piezoelectric thin film 1 extends/contracts and the movable section 23 is driven toward the substrate 21.
