The philosophy is to classify documents in several sub-groups as the case may be, i.e. the classifier should not stop the classification task once that the first suitable EC symbol is found, but he should continue to assign EC symbols until all the aspects have been properly classified.The subclass has a very large number of related technical areas, e.g.:""application"" fields such as transmitters, receivers, voltage regulators, multimedia devices, etc.Indexing Code orthogonal classificationIn addition to one or more classification symbols relating to the invention information, where appropriate, one or more Indexing Code symbols relating to orthogonal classification ( - ), i.e. covering aspects which are spanning over one or more groups, should be allocated for the following ranges:, , , Vacuum tube amplifiers classificationThe following IPC groups, which are mostly related to discharge tube amplifiers or general type amplifiers, are used to classify circuit topologies based also on vacuum tubes, valve amplifiers, due to historical reasons (see vacuum tube amplifier in the ""Glossary of terms"" section below):, ","H03F2200/03|H03F2200/555|H03F1/00|H03F1/565|H03F3/181|H03F3/213|H03F3/24|H03F3/72|H03F1/04|H03F1/07|H03F1/13|H03F1/16|H03F1/20|H03F1/24|H03F1/28|H03F1/33|H03F1/36|H03F1/40|H03F1/50|H03F1/54|H03F3/02|H03F3/181|H03F3/189|H03F3/22|H03F3/28|H03F3/36|H03F3/40|H03F3/44|H03F3/48|H03F3/52|H03F3/64","Class A Amplifying devices operating in class A conduct in their linear range over the whole of the input cycle.Class B Amplifying devices operating in class B conduct in their linear range half of the time and are turned off for the other halfClass AB Amplifying devices operating in class AB conduct in their linear range for more than half of the timeClass C Amplifying devices operating in class C conduct in their linear range for less than half of the timeClass D In the basic class-D amplifier the input signal is converted into a sequence of pulse width modulated (PWM) pulses via a comparator (C). Said PWM sequence is amplified via switching amplifying devices and filtered in order to produce an amplified replica of said input signal at the output.Class E The basic topology of class-E amplifier includes a transistor T, operated as a switch, a shunt capacitor (C1) which includes the intrinsic transistor output capacitance, RF choke inductor (L1), a load resistor R, a series resonance circuit (Co, Lo), and an excess inductance XL. The reactive elements shape the current and voltage waveforms across the transistor as shown. Thus as current flows, there is essentially no voltage across the device and a highly efficient switching power amplifier is achieved.Class F In realizing a class F amplifier, the active device operates primarily as a switch and the output network, generally, is designed to yield short circuit impedances at even harmonics of the fundamental frequency and to yield open circuit impedances at odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency. (drawing extracted from US4717884)Class G The Class G amplifiers (which use ""rail switching"" to decrease power consumption and increase efficiency) provide several power rails at different voltages (HV, LV) and switch between them as the signal output approaches each level. Thus, the amplifier increases efficiency by reducing the wasted power at the output transistors.Class H Class-H amplifiers take the idea of class G one step further creating an infinitely variable supply rail. This is done by modulating the supply rails (VCC, VEE) so that the rails are only a few volts larger than the output signal at any given time. The output stage operates at its maximum efficiency all the time. Switched-mode power supplies can be used to create the tracking rails.Class S Class S amplifiers are used essentially for RF transmitters or as tracking power supply building blocks. The basic architecture consists of a modulator, e.g., of delta-sigma type, a fast broadband switch-mode amplifier, and an advanced filter at the output. The big advantage of the concept is that it can potentially be driven with a digital input without A/D conversion at the input.Totem pole Amplifier with two or more amplifying elements having their DC paths in series with the load, the control electrode of each element being excited by at least part of the input signal (drawing extracted from US3986132). Distributed amplifier The input/output terminals of the amplifying elements are connected in series through respective distributed elements. (drawing extracted from US2005285680)Doherty Amplifier Amplifier using a main and one or several auxiliary peaking amplifiers wherein the load is connected to the main amplifier using an impedance inverter. (drawing extracted from WO2011097114)Push Pull The amplifying devices are each used for amplifying the opposite halves of the input signal.Single Ended Push Pull Push pull amplifier wherein the output terminals of the amplifying elements are tied together as a single ended output without additional balun elements. Differential amplifier the basic differential amplifier amplifies the difference between two voltages; the output voltage is determined according to the following equation:  wherein Ac is the common mode gain and Ad is the differential mode gain.Common mode rejection ratiothe common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) indicates the ability of the amplifier to accurately cancel voltages that are common to both inputs. The common-mode rejection ratio is defined as: Vacuum tube amplifier Until the invention of the transistor in 1947, all practical amplifiers were made using Vacuum tubes, which rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament (cathode), that then travel through a vacuum toward a collecting electrode (anode). The simplest vacuum tube was invented by John Ambrose Fleming while working for the Marconi Company in London in 1904 and named the diode, as it had two electrodes. The diode conducted electricity in one direction only and was used as a radio detector and a rectifier. In 1906 Lee De Forest added a third electrode (grid) and invented the first electronic amplifying device, the triode, which he named the Audion. This additional control grid modulates the current that flows between cathode and anode. (drawing and historical background extracted from Wikipedia).Common emitter/source /cathode Amplifying device wherein the emitter/source/cathode terminal is connected to RF ground/earth and the input (control) terminal is the base/gate/grid.Common base/gate /grid Amplifying device wherein the base/gate/grid terminal is connected to RF ground/earth and the input (control) terminal is the emitter/source/cathode.Cascade coupling Two or more amplifying devices wherein the output terminal of the first device is connected to the input (control) terminal of the second device in order to form a chain of amplifying elements.Cascode coupling A cascade coupling of a common emitter/source/cathode amplifying device followed by a common base/gate/grid amplifying device.Common collector/drain/anode, i.e. Emitter/source /cathode follower Amplifying device wherein the input (control) terminal is the base/gate/grid, and the output terminal is the emitter/source/cathode. The output voltage ""follows"" the input voltage, because the voltage gain almost equals one.Emitter/Source degeneration Amplifying device in common emitter/source/cathode configuration wherein an additional element (degeneration element) is connecting the emitter/source/cathode terminal with the RF ground/earth.Darlington amplifier Bipolar transistors are in Darlington configuration when they have the collector terminals tied together and the emitter of the first transistor is connected to the base of the second transistor so that the current gain of the composite transistor is increased.Bridge type Two amplifying devices are in bridge type when the output signal of one device is in opposition of phase with the output signal of the other device. A load is connected between the two amplifying device outputs, bridging the output terminals. This can double the voltage swing at the load as compared with the same amplifying device used alone without bridging.Esaki diode Esaki diode is a type of semiconductor diode which is capable of very fast operation, well into the microwave frequency region, by using quantum mechanical effects. When forward-biased, an odd effect occurs called ""quantum mechanical tunnelling"" which gives rise to a region where an increase in forward voltage is accompanied by a decrease in forward current (negative resistance region)Chopper amplifier A basic chopper amplifier is formed by adding so-called choppers S1 and S2 before and after an input stage A1. The choppers consist of switches with two positions. In the first position, the inputs I1 and I2 are connected to the outputs O1 and O2, respectively. In the second position, the inputs I1 and I2 are connected to the outputs O2 and O1, respectively. The choppers S1 and S2 are synchronized to repeatedly switch between the first and the second positions at the rate of a clock signal f1. This configuration is commonly used to reduce the offset (e.g. Vos1) and the flicker noise. (drawing extracted from US2003189461)Differential amplifier long tail pair The basis configuration of a long-tailed pair (LTP) differential amplifier consists of two amplifying transistors, which are connected so that the BJT emitters (or FET sources, or valve cathodes) are connected together. The common electrodes are then connected to a circuit, forming the ""long tail"" of the name, the long tail providing a current source, i.e. having a very high equivalent impedance in parallel, so that high common mode rejection ratio is achieved. (drawing extracted from US2011090010).Differential amplifier PI type The basic configuration of a PI type differential amplifier consists of two amplifying transistors, which are connected so that the BJT emitters (or FET sources, or valve cathodes) are connected together via a resistor. The resistor terminals are then respectively connected to a shunting current source, forming the ""PI"" of the name, so that high common mode rejection ratio is achieved. (drawing extracted from US2009289714).Pseudo differential amplifier The basic configuration of a pseudo differential amplifier consists of two amplifying transistors, wherein the BJT emitters (or FET sources, or valve cathodes) are not connected together but directly coupled to the ground. Thus, since the difference between I1 and I2 is output in proportion to the difference between gate signals Va, Vb, the configuration acts as a differential transconductance amplifier (drawing extracted from US2009115461).Reflex amplifier In a basic reflex amplifier an AC input signal is amplified and then rectified and, using the same circuit elements, the fed back resultant rectified DC signal is again amplified. The reflex circuit thus achieves two stages of amplification, plus rectification, in a single stage. (drawing extracted from US2863066).Travelling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA) A travelling wave tube (TWT) integrated with a regulated power supply and protection circuits is referred to as a travelling wave-tube amplifier (TWTA). The basic configuration of a TWT is an elongated vacuum tube with an electron gun (a heated cathode that emits electrons) at one end. A magnetic containment field around the tube focuses the electrons into a beam, which then passes down the middle of an RF circuit (wire helix or coupled cavity) that stretches from the RF input to the RF output, the electron beam finally striking a collector at the other end. A directional coupler, which can be either a waveguide or an electromagnetic coil, fed with the low-powered radio signal that is to be amplified, is positioned near the emitter, and induces a current into the helix. The RF circuit acts as a delay line, in which the RF signal travels at near the same speed along the tube as the electron beam. The electromagnetic field due to the RF signal in the RF circuit interacts with the electron beam, causing bunching of the electrons (an effect called velocity modulation), and the electromagnetic field due to the beam current then induces more current back into the RF circuit (i.e. the current builds up and thus is amplified as it passes down). A second directional coupler, positioned near the collector, receives an amplified version of the input signal from the far end of the RF circuit. (drawing extracted from US5500621).Klystron A klystron amplifies RF signals by converting the kinetic energy in a DC electron beam into radio frequency power. A beam of electrons is produced by a thermionic cathode (a heated pellet of low work function material), and accelerated by high-voltage electrodes (typically in the tens of kilovolts). This beam is then passed through an input cavity. RF energy is fed into the input cavity at, or near, its natural frequency to produce a voltage which acts on the electron beam. The electric field causes the electrons to bunch: electrons that pass through during an opposing electric field are accelerated and later electrons are slowed, causing the previously continuous electron beam to form bunches at the input frequency. To reinforce the bunching, a klystron may contain additional ""buncher"" cavities. The RF current carried by the beam will produce an RF magnetic field, and this will in turn excite a voltage across the gap of subsequent resonant cavities. In the output cavity, the developed RF energy is coupled out. The spent electron beam, with reduced energy, is captured in a collector.Envelope Elimination and Restoration (EER) The Envelope elimination and restoration technique was first proposed in 1952 by L.R. Kahn as a way to linearise nonlinear amplifiers. In Kahn's approach, an RF input signal is processed by two parallel paths. In one path, the envelope of the RF input signal is ""eliminated"" using a limiting amplifier that removes any amplitude modulation and which provides a phase modulated signal. In the other path, the RF input signal envelope is detected, amplified, and applied to the PA as an amplitude modulating power supply voltage. The EER technique allows the phase modulated signal to be amplified with high efficiency using a saturated power amplifier, which has an amplitude modulating power supply voltage, in order to restore the RF signal envelope at the output of said amplifier and to obtain linear amplification of the RF input signal.Envelope Tracking (ET) In the Envelope Tracking configuration, the power amplifier is fed with a fully-modulated RF signal (RFin) at the input and supplied with a modulated drain bias (Vout) in accordance with the envelope of the modulated signal (Venv). As a result, the power amplifier at all times is kept near saturation where the efficiency is highest. (drawing extracted from US7808323)Charge amplifier A charge amplifier is a current integrator driven by an electrical source with capacitive nature such as a piezoelectric sensor. Contrary to what its name may suggest, a charge amplifier does not amplify the electric charge present at its input (it can amplify only the exciting input voltage). The charge amplifier just transfers the input charge to another reference capacitor and produces an output voltage equal to the voltage across the reference capacitor. Thus the output voltage is proportional to the charge of the reference capacitor and, respectively, to the input charge; hence the circuit acts as a charge-to-voltage converter. Charge amplifiers are usually constructed using op-amps with a feedback capacitor.
