Example 1: neuraminic acid the saccharide radical of neuraminic acid consists of an uninterrupted carbon skeleton and oxygen atoms directly attached thereto, and is considered to be terminated by the bond of carbon number 1 to the carboxylic radical (the saccharide radical has 8 carbon atoms altogether). It contains: - (point i above) within the 8-carbon-atom skeleton an unbranched sequence of at the most six carbon atoms (see numbering below) in which at least three carbon atoms have one single bond to an oxygen atom as the only hetero bond (see carbon atoms numbered 3, 4, 5, 6), and - (point A above) in the cyclic sequence at least one other carbon atom (carbon 1) has two single bonds to oxygen atoms as the only hetero bonds, - (point ii above) the saccharide radical of neuraminic acid does not contain further double bonds, - it is derived by replacing one of the bond to oxygen by a bond to nitrogen (nitrogen connected to carbon 4) The first molecule (neuraminic acid) has one ""non-saccharide"" radical attached to carbon 1 and possible classification can only be  (ketoaldonic acid at position 1, see also IPC definition). The second molecule has one ""non-saccharide"" radical attached to carbon 1 ( , ketoaldonic acid) another ""non-saccharide"" radical attached to carbon 1 ( , methyl ether), the right classification is  according to the last place priority rule, as the anomeric oxygen in methylated. Examples 2-3: in the following two examples the saccharide radical (for the purpose of this classification only) is the whole molecule, and the unbranched sequence of at the most six carbon atoms is indicated with a bracket within the saccharide radical:  Examples 4-5: The saccharide radical is the carbon skeleton of 7 carbon atoms, and the unbranched sequence of at the most six carbon atoms is numbered from 1 to 6 in the two molecules. The first molecule has two ""non-saccharide"" radicals attached to carbons 1 and 7, possible classifications could be  ( phosphate radical at position 7 ) or  (radical at oxygen at position 1). The correct classification is then  according to the last place priority rule. The same applies to the second molecule, which has however only one possible classification, i.e. . Examples 6-7:  The saccharide radical is the carbon skeleton numbered from 1 to 6 in the two molecules . The saccharide radical starts at the anomeric carbon atom, having a bond to a carbon atom of a cyclic structure (phenyl), wich ""terminates"" the saccharide radical . The first molecule has one ""non-saccharide"" radical attached to carbon 1, the only possible classification is  (phenyl group) . The second molecule has two ""non-saccharide"" radicals attached to carbon 1, possible classifications could be  (phenyl group) or  ( methyl at the oxygen connected to carbon 1). The correct classification of the second molecule is then  according to the last place priority rule. Hemiacetal and hemiketal forms of saccharide radicals Saccharide radicals derived from cyclic tautomers of acyclic polyhydroxy-aldehydes or acyclic polyhydroxy-ketones are in cyclic hemiacetal and hemiketal forms. This is a type of stereoisomerism involving formation of an asymmetrical centre at the aldehyde carbon in aldoses and the keto carbon in ketoses. Examples are given for glucose and fructose below.  Different projections exist for depicting those cyclic tautomers. The projections of α-D-glucopyranose are illustrated below:  1 = fischer projection; 2 = haworth projection, 3 = chair/conformation projection, 4 = mills projection As illustrated for glucose and fructose, the cyclic structures are formed by the addition of the hydroxyl group (−OH) from either the fourth, fifth, or sixth carbon atom (in the diagram, the numbers 1 through 6 represent the positions of the carbon atoms) to the carbonyl group  at position 1 in glucose or 2 in fructose. A five-membered ring is illustrated for the ketohexose, fructose; a six-membered ring is illustrated for the aldohexose, glucose. By definition, the carbon atom containing the aldehydo  is termed the anomeric carbon atom; similarly, carbohydrate stereoisomers that differ in configuration only at this carbon atom are called anomers. When a cyclic hemiacetal or hemiketal structure forms, the structure with the new hydroxyl group projecting on the same side (in the fisher projection) as that of the oxygen involved in forming the ring is termed the alpha anomer that with the hydroxyl group projecting on the opposite side (in the fisher projection) from that of the oxygen ring is termed the beta anomer (see diagram).  Note: Cyclic structure forms can be classified in  only if they have an anomeric carbon atom (i.e. a cyclic hemiacetal/acetal or hemiketal/ketal). Note: on the anomeric carbon the two hetero bonds to oxygen can be replaced by the same number of hetero bonds to halogen, nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, or tellurium (see point (b) above).  SaltCompound consisting of at least one anionic part and at least one cationic part. Carboxylate salts – products where the hydrogen in a carboxyl group is replaced by an ion of metal or other cation.","This place covers: Compounds containing saccharide radicals, sugars and their derivatives, e.g.: Saccharides, deoxysugars, anhydrosugars and 1,2-ketoaldoses; Aminosugars, aza-, thio-, seleno- and telluro analogues; Sugar esters, sugar ethers, glucosides and cyclic acetals; Sugar derivatives containing acylic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic radicals; Sugar derivatives containing boron, silicon or a metal; Nucleosides, nucleotides Nucleic acids produced by chemical preparation Processes for the preparation of the above compounds."
