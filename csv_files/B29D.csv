See also: radial tyreGreen tyrea pneumatic tyre which has not yet undergone the moulding and vulcanizing process. Since the rubber is uncured, the green tyre is tacky, soft and not capable of maintaining its shapePneumatic tyrea tyre made of reinforced rubber, holding compressed air. Pneumatic tyres consist of bands of corded fabric, or ""plies,"" coated with rubber. Bias ply tyres have the plies overlaid at an angle to the other layers. Radial tyres have all plies laid at 90 degrees to the tyre body or casing. See also: solid tyreRadial tyrea particular type of tyre construction which utilizes beads that run perpendicular (90 degrees) to the direction of travel, stretched from bead to bead. They are typically reinforced with steel or nylon belts. See also: bias-ply tyreRun-Flat tyre a type of tyre that permits travel with reduced internal pressure (deflated) for a limited mileage range at a limited speedSolid tyresolid tyres have no hollow center and hold no air (non-pneumatic tyre). They are typically made of plastic or a composite of rubber/plastic and are used mostly on lawnmowers, skateboards, scooters, etc. The fact that pneumatic tyres can be punctured and lose air pressure makes them unsuitable for certain applications. For instance, tyres used by the military, in construction and on forklifts are often made with solid rubber or filled with resilient foamStudded tyretyre that comes with small metal studs embedded into the tread blocks, or holes where studs can be manually inserted, to provide better traction in inclement driving conditionsTubeless tyrea pneumatic tyre which does not require a rubber inner tube to hold the air pressure. Tubeless tyres have a stiff bead on the edges of the sidewall that form an airtight seal with the wheel, eliminating the need for an inner tube .See also: solid tyre, inner tube, inner linerApex (aka bead filler)tyre component made from a very hard rubber compound, which is extruded so as to form a wedge; it is joined to bead core on its radially external surfaceBeadthe innermost portion of a tyre on either side, where it seats to the rim. A bead is reinforced with concentric steel wires to ensure a tight seal against the rim. It also prevents damage to the tyre during installation and removalBead ring (aka bead core)a structure composed of high tensile strength steel wire formed into hoops which function as anchors for the plies and hold the tyre assembly onto the rim of the wheelBelt (aka breaker)one or more layers of rubber-coated tyre cord or rubber-encased steel cords located directly beneath the tread that run circumferentially in the crown of the tyre. The belt purpose is to reinforce the tread and help maintain a tyre's shape under a wide variety of conditions including tyre pressure variations, centrifugal forces and cornering and braking forces, for example. Belts also improve tread wear and help resist damage from impacts and penetrationBias Ply (aka as Cross-Ply)bias ply tyres have belts that run diagonally across and on top of each other from bead to bead, typically at angles in the range of 30 to 40 degrees. This provides the advantage of allowing the tyre body more flexibility. This allows for a smoother ride over rough surfacesCarcass (aka casing)a typical structural part of a pneumatic tyre, comprising a network of cords or other reinforcing elements embedded in rubber, which typically gives the tyre its shape. The tread or sidewalls are not part of the carcassChafera narrow strip of rubber-coated abrasion-resistant material folded around the outside of the bead that protects the carcass cords against wear and cutting by the rim, distributes flex above the rim, and prevents dirt and moisture from getting into the tyreCorda strand of fabric, typically made of nylon, steel, rayon, fiberglass, polyester, or some combination of these materials, used in the making of carcass plies, belts or other reinforcing partsCrownthe entire outer perimeter of the contact surface of a tyre.

Most of the modern pneumatic radial tyres are manufactured according to the following main steps: a carcass including the tyre beads is built either on a toroidal core (the shape of said core being substantially correspondent to the shape of the finished tyre), or on a cylindrical drum; thereafter, the carcass built on the cylindrical drum is expanded into the final toroidal shape; the belt and the tread are applied to the toroidally expanded carcass; the sidewalls are applied to the toroidally expanded carcass; the green tyre so obtained is cured in a suitable mould. Other tyre manufacturing techniques include casting, centrifugal casting, compression moulding, injection moulding."
