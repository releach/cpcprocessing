Designs are arrangements or patterns of elements or features of an artistic or decorative work, e.g. an ornamental pattern. Pictures are visual representations or images of a subject or scene (e.g. a person, object or landscape) projected, painted, drawn or otherwise produced upon a surface. The designs or pictures are characterised as special by particular technical features used to create the patterns or images or by characteristic features of patterns or images which provide the special effects, especially: designs or pictures characterised by special or unusual light effects, e.g. produced by reflected or transmitted light, or characterised by colour effects; designs characterised by outlines or by irregular areas, e.g. mottled patterns; designs imitating three-dimensional effects, natural patterns or artistic work. This subclass also covers processes for creating such designs or pictures insofar as they are not covered by other places."
