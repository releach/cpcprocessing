The fabric is stretched by the use of a tenter frame, consisting of chains fitted with pins or clips to hold the selvedges of the fabric, and travelling on tracks. As the fabric passes through a heated chamber, creases and wrinkles are removed, the weave is straightened, and the fabric is dried to its final size.","This place covers: Apparatuses and methods for stretching, tentering or spreading textile fabrics."

"D06C17/00","Fulling","","","","","","fullingis a finishing process used usually in the manufacture of woolen and worsted fabrics.

Microcreping, sometimes called ""dry microcreping"", refers to longitudinal treatment of travelling fabric under substantially dry conditions in which a drive force is produced by pressing the fabric against a drive roll. This positively propels the material through a confined retarding passage, with microcreping action on the material occurring in the transition between driving and retarding regions. Because such microcreping does not depend upon adhesion of the material to the drive surface or a wet condition of the material, a particularly wide range of properties is obtainable. Note that the dry microcreping here must not be confused with wet creping or creping based on adhesion, performed for instance on a Yankee dryer."
