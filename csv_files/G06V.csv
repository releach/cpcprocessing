These aspects involve the detection, categorisation, identification, authentication of image or video patterns by acquiring, preprocessing, extracting distinctive features or matching, supervised or unsupervised clustering or classification of these features or representations derived from them leading to one or several decisions, related confidence values (e.g. probabilities) or classification/clustering labels for explanatory purposes or to derive a certain meaning. Pattern recognition or pattern learning in a specific, image or video-related context that includes: scene-related patterns and scene-specific elements -    character recognition or recognising digital ink; document-oriented image-based pattern recognition â€“  human-related, animal-related or biometric patterns in in image or video data  . Typical image or video understanding systems that include one or more of the following steps:  Figure 1. Processing steps involved in a pattern recognition system These steps are provided as follows: image acquisition ( ), image preprocessing ( ), feature extraction ( ), pattern recognition or pattern learning, e.g. matching, clustering or classifying techniques ( ). Image or video recognition can be carried out by using electronic means ( ) or by using optical means ( ). Typically, a pattern recognition system involves one or more of the following techniques: Individual data entity Groups of data entities (classes) One data sample  Authentication Categorisation Several data samples Identification Clustering When a collection of data samples is provided, identification means selecting a particular sample having a (predefined) characteristic which distinguishes it from the others. Several data samples are generally matched against the one to be identified in a many-to-one process. Authentication involves verifying the identity of a sample using a test of genuineness and it involves a one-to-one comparison with the genuine (authentic) sample. Categorisation means assigning a data sample to a class according to certain distinguishing properties (or characteristics) of that class and it generally involves a one-to-many test in which one data sample is compared with the characteristics of several classes. Clustering means grouping data samples in groups or classes based on their properties (or characteristics) and it generally involves a many-to-many (dis)similarity test."
