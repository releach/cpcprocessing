"B01F","MIXING, e.g. DISSOLVING, EMULSIFYING OR DISPERSING  (mixing paints B44D3/06)","B44D3/06","","","In general, devices and methods in which agitation and or contact of materials is produced, the object of said agitation/contact being different than for obtaining an homogeneous mixture (e.g. mass transfer devices and processes, a mere contact of two or more different materials, devices or processes in which agitation/homogenization is intrinsic to the process per se but it is not the primary purpose) are not classified in this subclass.As a general rule, the following information is to be classified in its whole extent:What is mixed, i.e. the phases of materials being mixed: groups  and .How it is mixed: groups , , ,  and .Auxiliary information: groups .The use of substances used as emulsifying, wetting, dispersing or foam-producing agents is normally only classified in , except when the related devices for mixing are also disclosed.With regard to the phases to be mixed, the following is to be observed:when only a general reference to the phases is indicated, only the Indexing Codes  and  are used;if reference is made to the use of the device for any kind of mixtures, it is not classified in , ,  or ;when the application is of relevance (i.e. the type of product produced is claimed or the device is claimed for making a specific product) then it is also classified in the corresponding application field;if the possible application or applications are only mentioned in a generic way (i.e. as possible uses of the device) then the corresponding KW is used instead.With regard to the way of mixing all parts of the device which are used for mixing are classified in its corresponding group. When more than one mixing device form part of the apparatus, the device is also classified in .With regard to the auxiliary information the corresponding general fields, if they exist, take precedence. If the only possible classification symbol which can be allocated is a symbol in the group  then it has to be classified in the general field (e.g. if it can only be classified in  then it is a clear indication that it has to be classified in ).","B01F21/00|B01F23/00|B01F25/00|B01F27/00|B01F29/00|B01F31/00|B01F33/00|B01F35/00|C09K23/00|B01F21/00|B01F23/00|B01F21/00|B01F23/00|B01F21/00|B01F23/00|B01F33/80|B01F35/00|B01F35/90|F28","Mixing stirring of a single material","This place covers: Agitation and/or homogenization of products formed by a combination of two or more components with the purpose of obtaining an homogeneous composition or homogeneous conditions in the mass of material. Stirring of a single material with the purpose of obtaining homogeneous conditions in the mass of material. This subclass covers the mixing, agitation and homogenization of materials, irrespective of the application in which it is produced, whenever the device and/or method is directed to achieve said desired effect."
