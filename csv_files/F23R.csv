Examples of such special adaptations are: Specialised configuration in order to be incorporated in a power plant, for example as a combustion chamber between the compressor stage and the turbine stage of a gas turbine plant, or as an afterburner in a jet engine; Specialised construction for tolerating high temperatures, for example film cooling or diffusion cooling; Specialised arrangements for supplying combustion air, cooling air or dilution air; Specialised arrangements for fuel injection.
