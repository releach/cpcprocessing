The phosphate crystals formed on the surfaces of materials can be iron, zinc, or manganese phosphates. Among these phosphates, manganese phosphate is more suitable for wear applications. Phosphate coatings are usually applied to carbon steel, low-alloy steel, and cast iron. They can also be applied to zinc, cadmium, aluminum, and tin. Phosphate processes are hard to apply on high alloys for these alloys are likely immune to the phosphoric acid. In short, phosphating is one of the most useful non-metallic conversion coatings.Chromate coatingsChromate coatings, similar to phosphate coatings, are processes of chemical conversion. But the chromate coatings are formed by the reaction of water solutions of chromic acid or chromium salts. The coatings can be applied to aluminum, zinc, cadmium, and magnesium. The coatings usually have good atmospheric corrosion resistance. Chromate coatings are widely used in protecting common household products, such as screws, hinges, and many hardware items with the yellow-brown appearance.Oxide coatingsThe oxide coatings are in fact corrosion products which is a thin, usually less than 2.5 Âµm oxide with good adhesion. The oxide treatments are done by heat, chemicals, or electrochemical reactions.Bluing-type oxidations gun -bluing -type oxidations are done by heating the metals, generally steel, at 370ÂºC in a steam atmosphere. Chemical baths produce coatings similar to a gun bluing coating by immersion techniques.Black oxide or blackening coatingsBlack oxide or blackening coatings is a conversion coating for steel, copper, zinc, powder metals and silver solder, and most for stainless steel by treating with hot caustic soda (blackening agent). Some pastes can be rubbed on surfaces to produce similar results.
