Otherwise, classification is made under all appropriate subgroups, and not under the said higher group.In this subclass, ""preparation"" covers purification, separation, stabilisation or use of additives, unless a separate place is provided therefore.Chemical compounds and their preparation are classified in the groups for the type of compound prepared.If of interest, e.g. if the process relates to the preparation of known compounds and involves novel process/preparation features, the processes of preparation are also classified in the groups for the types of reaction employed. If no specific preparation class is foreseen, the preparation is classified in the class for the product obtained by the process.Compounds obtained by the claimed process are -as a rule- not classified (rationale is that a compound is not novel because it has been prepared by a novel process). However, if the product obtained by the process according to the invention can be considered novel, then that product should be classified (this would apply to products that can best be described by a product-by-process definition).General processes for the preparation of a class of compounds falling into more than one main group are classified in the groups for the processes employed, when such groups exist.Metal-containing compounds that do not have a metal-carbon bond but that can be represented by the formula: (L1)-Metal-(L2) (n>0 and m>0); L1 and L2 are different metal-bound moieties, and their preparation are classified in .Salts of a compound, unless specifically provided for, are classified as that compound. Carboxylic acid salts are classified as the carboxylic acid, e.g. sodium malonate is classified as malonic acid (in ). A mercaptide is classified as the mercaptan. Metal chelates are dealt with in the same way. Metal alcoholates and metal phenates are classified in subclass  and not in subclass .Salts, adducts or complexes formed between two or more organic compounds are classified according to all compounds forming the salts, adducts or complexes.Compounds containing unusual isotopes are classified in  and  and get the code  compounds on a support get -in addition to the  class- the code  compounds containing unusual isotopes are classified in  and in .In addition to the classification in , a document has to be forwarded for classification to the field relating to the use or application of the compound, entity comprising the compounds (if such use or application or entity is claimed or specifically described). As an exception, the medical use () of novel compounds is not forwarded for classification. Likewise, documents relating to apparatus used in processes have to be forwarded to the appropriate fields.","C07C|C07K|C07F|C07C55/08|C07C|C07F|C07F|C07B59/00|C07B2200/05|C07F|C07F|C07B2200/11|C07F|C07F|C07B59/00|C07F|A61K31/00","Chelatechemical compound consisting of a central metal atom attached by coordinate bonds to at least two non-metal atoms of a molecule, called a ligand, in a cyclic or ring structureMetal-bound moietyNOT: -H2O, -CNMetallocenechemical compound containing a metal attached to at least one cyclopentadienyl or cyclopentadienyl-derivativeNon-metalsH, B, C, Si, N, P, O, S, Se, Te, noble gases, halogensMetalselements other than non-metalsMetalloidsB, Si, Ge, As, Sb","This place covers: Pure organic compounds containing one or more of the elements B, Ge, Si, P, As, Sb and their preparation.
