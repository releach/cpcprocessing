"A23V2002/00","Food compositions, function of food ingredients or processes for food or foodstuffs","","",""," scheme is used to index food processes and function and/or composition of food. The indexing system is used as additional information to indicate more specific features of a composition, e.g. a particular additive (such as a gum or plant extract) which is significant for the invention.general format: ,symbol1,symbol2,symbol3,symbol4,... the order of the symbols does not matterIn addition, the indexing system is used as additional information to indicate a particular function of an ingredient : e.g. carbon dioxide as foaming agent is indexed:,, At least one symbol is associated with  but preferably two or more symbols (generally up to about 15-18 symbols) may be used in combination, the number of combination symbols is however not limited.several different combinations should be given for different compositions, e.g. composition 1 : , symbol1,symbol2,symbol3composition 2 : , symbol1,symbol3,symbol4,symbol5specific examples are indexed in priority as far as possible, comparative examples may also be indexed.if less than 5 to10 examples : all examples should be indexedmore than 10 examples : the most significant ones only are indexedif less than 15 indexable components : all components (and possibly function(s), processes) are indexed.If several functions/processes are associated with different combinations of ingredients (composition), multiple combinations should be given, e.g. (funct1,2,3,.. = symbol for function ; ingr1,2,3,.. = symbol for ingredient),funct1,ingr2,ingr3,ingr4,ingr6,funct2,ingr2,ingr5,ingr7,ingr8,funct3,ingr2,ingr6,ingr8,ingr9If several functions are associated with the same composition, all functions can be indexed in the same combination, e.g. ,funct1,funct2,funct3,ingr1,ingr2,ingr3if more than 15 indexable components : the most significant ones are indexed and/or mixture symbols are used, e.g.  for vitamin mixture,  for mineral mixture. if no example present, the claims are indexed (preferably the dependent claims comprising the greatest number of components in combination).","A23V2002/00|A23V2002/00|A23V2002/00|A23V2250/11|A23V2200/226|A23V2002/00|A23V2002/00|A23V2002/00|A23V2002/00|A23V2002/00|A23V2002/00|A23V2002/00|A23V2250/70|A23V2250/156","","This place covers: Foodstuffs and food processes compositions and processes.
