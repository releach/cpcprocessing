Therefore, they could be operable only for a single species or a small number of species. In addition, a clinical thermometer may be adapted to suit the morphology of a given species or small number of species. For example, the normal human body temperature is around 37 °C, and the medically dangerous condition of hyperpyrexia occurs around 41.5 °C, so that clinical thermometers need not be capable of measuring temperatures above 45 °C. A lower limit for the applicability of clinical thermometers in human beings would be set by medically-induced hypothermia, which is kept above 30 °C to avoid serious complications.
