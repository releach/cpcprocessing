"G04G","ELECTRONIC TIME-PIECES","","","","It should always be borne in mind that every document showing a timepicece which is not purely mechanical could potentially be classified in  and/or . There are mainly two reasons for this:1) Often it happens that the nature (electronic or electromechanical) of the timepiece is not the central point in a document. For example, in some cases, despite the presence of moving parts, the core of the document is focused on purely electronic aspects, therefore this document would be classified rather in  than .2)  and  follow a structure which is only partly parallel (see also the definition of ). For example, whilst  finds an equivalent group in , other groups such as ,  or  have no equivalent in . For this reason, in the practise, some groups of  are still used to classify documents showing timepieces with moving parts and for which  does not offer a technically detailed possibility for classification.","G04G|G04C|G04G|G04C|G04C|G04G|G04C|G04G15/00|G04C23/00|G04G17/00|G04G19/00|G04G21/00|G04C|G04G|G04C","","This place covers: The definition of an electronic timepiece is: a timepiece in which the time reference (signal) is obtained solely by electronic means.
