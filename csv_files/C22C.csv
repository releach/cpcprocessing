For example in an alloy with Ni 40 wt%, Fe 30 wt% Co 30 wt%, the base of the alloy is Ni.It is possible for an alloy to have more than one base major constituent.When the alloy contains less than 50 wt% of each constituent, i.e. alloy with more than one base, then in addition to the  corresponding to the major constituent(s) at least one  class is also given depending on the rest of the main alloying elements.In -, -,  classes are given for both inventive and additionally disclosed alloys, whether in the claims, description, figures or inventive examplesThe compositions of amorphous alloys are classified in . The methods of making Fe-based amorphous alloys are classified in . The methods of making amorphous alloys (other than Fe-based ones) are classified in . Semi-amorphous alloys are classified both as amorphous and as crystalline ones ( and -). The compositions of cast-iron alloys are classified in . The methods of making cast-iron alloys are classified in -.Alloys based on a metal not provided for in the groups -  e.g. Ga-based, In-based alloys etc. are classified in .In the groups -, -, the last place rule is followed (classification in the last appropriate place) combined with multiple classifications, for a classification of a 100% disclosed alloy composition.In this subclass a computerised search system is available for online searching via the database ""Alloys"" of EPOQUE. This system, used as a search aid, contains all patent documents classified in groups  and  -  and provides information on the composition of the alloys, their uses and characteristics.The alloy composition(s) is/are indexed in the Alloys database and different records are created for all disclosed alloy composition on the basis of:a) the claims taken in combination with the description of the application as well as b) the inventive examples (individual examples, tables). In this case fictive elemental ranges are created with lower limits and upper limits as disclosed in the inventive examples disclosed in the table(s).Rules for indexing compositions, composites and layers in  and :Classes: +, +, +, +, +, +, +, .Indexed are the claims, usually not the entire document.In case the claims are rather broad, examples are being indexed.As a rule only the end products are indexed, not disclosed method or intermediates products.However, if those methods or intermediate products are significants, they may be indexed as well.The word ""particles"" used throughout this document covers both powder and fibre (or other geometrical) forms, unless indicated specifically otherwise.Particles and mixtures of particles are indexed only by a combination of Indexing-codes which form a string. Specific compositions (by specific ranges) are also classified in the Alloys database of EPOQUE. If the particles are processed into a product having a specific composition, that is one with specific ranges, then the document should be classified in the corresponding  class. If the composition is not specific and different from the original particle composition (e.g. due to mixing or reaction with other materials during processing) then this should be indexed by an Indexing Code-string.Definitions:Non-metals are, according to the IPC: B C H N O P S Se Si Te, noble gases, halogens.Metals: elements other than non-metals.Metal compounds include: borides, carbide, hydrides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, silicides, selenides, tellurides, carbonitrides.Note: a silicide, selenide or telluride is not an intermetallic according to our coding, even though much scientific litterature designates them as such.Intermetallic compounds (IM) and complex compounds:A constituent out of an intermetallic or a complex compound is described in one string with the other constituents.E.g. a Ni alloy with Co which includes an IM out of Al and Ti., , , , ;, , ;E.g. a Ni alloy with an IM of Al and Ni and Potassium aluminate, , , , ;, , ;, , , ;An IM and a complex oxide in sequence is also possible.Complex borides, carbides, nitrides, oxides, silicides, sulfides, carbonitrides, carboxides:A complex compound as above comprises two or more metallic elements with a non-metallic element(s).The indexing follows the same rules as for IM (intermetallic)e.g.: an Al alloy which includes a complex carbide comprising Mo and W:, ;, , ;or which includes a complex boride comprising Ti and Zr:, ;, ,  ;or which includes a complex carbonitride comprising Ta and Ti:, ;, , , ;Aluminates, borates, carbonates, nitrates, phosphates, silicates and sulphates are not indexed as complex oxides but indicated as ""other"". They should be retrieved by full text search.Carbon, graphite, diamond and carbon nanotubes are separately indexed as well.e.g. carbon nanotubes coated with iron, , or an iron particle coated with carbon nanotubes, , Classification aspects:The alloying elements of the particle, fibre, mix or layer can be disclosed either as obligatory or as optional. These codes can be connected with other code words like ""coating alloy"".The elements are listed according to their wt%.: highest weight first, for a range the lowest limit of that range. If not specified: alphabetically.The main component is not necessarily over 50%. If more elements can be the main component, they are listed in sequence. When some of the elements could be an alloying element as well, they must be repeated in a sentence with alloy.A coating is used only for material that covers the surface of a particle or fibre. It is indexed by including the corresponding class ( or ) followed by the elements/components making up the coating (see example above).If multiple coatings are applied the corresponding class is repeated within the string.When the coating is formed of individual particles or fibres, then the appropriate Indexing Code is indicated in the string as well.For fibres the corresponding class ( or ) is put in the string.A molten metal infiltrating a metal preform will be indicated in addition to the overall composition.note: when molten metal infiltrates a preform out of ceramic material, not being fibre, the ceramic material is described as a compulsory alloy component with the metal as the main component (or vice versa in case of a cermet being formed).Each layer in a layered product is indexed in a separate string. When one of the layers has the function of a support layer and which is not made by powder metallurgy, this is indicated as ""support layer"" together with the layer composition to which it is attached.e.g. a layered product comprising two layers formed by powder metallurgy on top of a cast metal support: A first layer of Al, a second layer of an Al alloy having 4 compulsory alloy components and optionally carbides, oxides or nitrides as alloying components, supported by a steel sheet (not made by powder metallurgy)., ;, , , , , +, , , , , , +, , , , , ;When a mixture of metal or non-metallic (compounds) forms a final composition which is not the aggregate of the ""ingredients"", the composition of the different parts of the mixture is indexed. Each new mixture is in a different paragraph. The coding is likely to occur in the classes - and class .e.g. A mixture of two powders is isostatically pressed and sintered.One powder consists of tungsten carbide with 5% of a Co binder, alloyed with Ni.Its size is from 10 to 50 micron. This powder constitutes the major part of the mixture.The second powder consists mainly of zirconium oxide and some aluminium-phosphate. Its size is more than 100 microns.This gives the following indexing:, , , , ;, , , , ;The size of the used powders may be of interest. If this is claimed or given as extra information in the text, the size ""range"" is indicated to avoid/surpass different nomenclature.","C22C|C22C30/00|C22C5/00|C22C30/00|C22C37/00|C22C45/00|C22C|C22C45/00|C22C33/003|C22C1/002|C22C45/00|C22C5/00|C22C38/00|C22C37/00|C22C33/08|C22C33/12|C22C5/00|C22C45/10|C22C28/00|C22C5/00|C22C30/00|C22C37/00|C22C45/00|C22C1/04|C22C5/00|C22C49/14|C22C|B22|C22C1/04|C22C1/05|C22C1/10|C22C26/00|C22C29/00|C22C32/00|C22C33/02|B22F|C22C|B22F2303/01|B22F2301/15|B22F2303/10|B22F2301/15|B22F2303/15|B22F2303/15|B22F2301/052|B22F2301/205|B22F2303/01|B22F2301/15|B22F2303/10|B22F2303/15|B22F2302/35|B22F2303/15|B22F2301/052|B22F2301/15|B22F2302/35|B22F2302/25|B22F2301/052|B22F2301/054|B22F2303/01|B22F2302/35|B22F2302/35|B22F2302/10|B22F2301/20|B22F2303/01|B22F2302/35|B22F2302/35|B22F2302/05|B22F2301/205|B22F2303/01|B22F2302/35|B22F2302/35|B22F2302/15|B22F2301/20|B22F2301/205|B22F2302/403|B22F1/17|B22F2301/35|B22F2301/35|B22F1/16|B22F2302/403|B22F1/16|B22F1/17|B22F1/0547|B22F1/062|B22F2303/40|B22F2301/052|B22F2303/40|B22F2301/052|B22F2303/05|B22F2301/10|B22F2301/20|B22F2302/40|B22F2302/45|B22F2303/10|B22F2302/105|B22F2302/253|B22F2302/10|B22F2302/20|B22F2302/205|B22F2303/405|B22F2301/35|B22F2303/05|B22F2302/40|C22C33/0207|C22C33/0228|B22F1/09|B22F2303/45|C22C29/08|B22F2303/05|B22F2301/15|B22F2304/10|B22F2303/45|B22F2302/25|B22F2302/45|B22F2304/10|B22F2304/15","AlloyA composition of plural elements at least one of which is a free metal.
