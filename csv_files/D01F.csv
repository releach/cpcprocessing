The first part relates to polyaddition polymers and the second part to polycondensation polymers. In turn, for each type of polymers a distinction is made between homopolymers, copolymers and blended polymers. When a document covers both homo- and copolymers the homopolymer group is always allocated, and the copolymer group is only allocated when specific information is given about the copolymer (e.g. type and amount of comonomers). vs. All fibres comprising 35-85% of acrylonitrile are classified in  even if the fibres are not defined as modacrylic. If an overlap exists on the amount of acrylonitrile both classifications should be allocated.Although the polyurethanes used to make fibres are normally copolymers, elastic polyurethane fibres are always classified in this subgroup","D01F6/38|D01F6/40|D01F6/40|D01F6/70","","This place covers: Monocomponent fibres or the like of synthetic polymers."
