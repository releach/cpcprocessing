Ferrites have a high magnetic permeability, which allows them to store stronger magnetic fields than iron, and are known as ceramic magnets. Applying a DC magnetic bias field to a ferrite will produce that a microwave signal will propagate differently in different directions, this effect can be utilized to fabricate directional devices as isolators, circulators and gyrators.

A photonic bandgap structure is a periodic arrangement of ""defects"" (e.g., pits or holes formed in layer of a device) that prevents the propagation of all electromagnetic waves within a particular frequency band. The defects introduce electrical frequency stop-bands much like a Bragg grating or crystal lattice structure introduces stop-bands in an optical transmission system. The spacing of the photonic bandgap structure's periodic defects determines the stop-band frequencies. An electromagnetic bandgap* structure (EBG) is recently receiving attention as a scheme to solve some noise problems in microwave applications. This is for the purpose of blocking a signal ranging a certain frequency band by arranging the EBG having a certain structure in a printed circuit board, and the typical EBG has roughly two, namely a Mushroom type EBG(MT-EBG) and a Planar type EBG(PT-EBG). * To have a better explanation of the electromagnetic bandgaps, see XP11037787, XP1034579"

A resonant post may be inserted in such a way that it penetrates the broad wall of the evanescent mode waveguide, thereby forming a shunt capacitive element between opposite conducting walls of the guide.

Its basic component, the NRD waveguide, consists of a rectangular section dielectric rod (height α, width 2w, permittivity εr), sandwiched between conductiong plates that are at a distance apart less than half the free space wavelength λ0: thus, all discontinuities that maintain appropriate symmetry become purely reactive, with the advantage of a strong reduction in interference and radiation problems in integrated circuits. The same waveguiding structure, but with a larger space between the plates, was already proposed in 1953 by Tischer with a view to obtaining an ultra-low-loss waveguide, know as H guide. In this situation the non radiation condition α < λ0/2 is no linger maintained and the structure suffers the drawback of undesirable radiation effects from discontinuities. See GB2360139, US-A-4028643, US-A-4463330, US-4677404."

"H01P5/18","consisting of two coupled guides, e.g. directional couplers","","","","","","","This place covers: Directional couplers are four-port circuits where one port is isolated from the input port. All four ports are (ideally) matched, and the circuit is (ideally) lossless. What do we mean by ""directional""? A directional coupler has four ports, where one is regarded as the input, one is regarded as the ""through"" port (where most of the incident signal exits), one is regarded as the coupled port (where a fixed fraction of the input signal appears, usually expressed in dB), and an isolated port, which is usually terminated. If the signal is reversed so that it enter the ""though"" port, most of it exits the ""input"" port, but the coupled port is now the port that was previously regarded as the ""isolated port"". The coupled port is a function of which port is the incident port. Looking at the generic directional coupler schematic above, if port 4 is the incident port, port 3 is the transmitted port (because it is connected with a straight line). Either port 1 or port 2 is the coupled port, and the other is the isolated port, depending on whether the coupling mode is forward or backward."

"H01P5/186","{Lange couplers}","","","","","","","This place covers: Lange couplers are generally used to couple electromagnetic energy between transmission lines. In a four port hybrid, there is an input port and a direct port, these two ports being directly and conductively connected to each other, as well as a coupled port, the latter being connected to transmission lines coupled electromagnetically (inductively and capacitively) to the conductors extending between the input and direct ports. In a Lange type coupler, each strip conductor is divided into mutually parallel sections, and the conductor sections from the two different strip conductors are interdigitated, so that each strip section is located between two sections from the other conductor. In a planar arrangement, it is necessary to have cross-over connectors in order to establish a direct conductive connection between the various sections extending in parallel."

Magic T waveguide junction The diagram above depicts a simplified version of the Magic T waveguide junction with its four ports. To look at the operation of the Magic T waveguide junction, take the example of when a signal is applied into the ""E plane"" arm. It will divide into two out of phase components as it passes into the leg consisting of the ""a"" and ""b"" arms. However no signal will enter the ""H plane"" arm as a result of the fact that a zero potential exists there - this occurs because of the conditions needed to create the signals in the ""a"" and ""b"" arms. In this way, when a signal is applied to the H plane arm, no signal appears at the ""E plane"" arm and the two signals appearing at the ""a"" and ""b"" arms are 180° out of phase with each other. Magic T waveguide junction signal directions When a signal enters the ""a"" or ""b"" arm of the magic T waveguide junction, then a signal appears at the E and H plane ports but not at the other ""b"" or ""a"" arm as shown."
