Mobility is possible between the devices of the active relay system and the transmission can be unidirectional or bidirectional. The processing within the relay is of a wide range. For instance the relay processing covers the following issues. The signals relayed can be a multiplex of a plurality of signals. The processing minimizes the interference between the signal received and retransmitted. Signal are regenerated, signals are switched in the relay before retransmission.
