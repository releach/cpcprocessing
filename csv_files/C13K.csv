"C13K","SACCHARIDES OBTAINED FROM NATURAL SOURCES OR BY HYDROLYSIS OF NATURALLY OCCURRING DISACCHARIDES, OLIGOSACCHARIDES OR POLYSACCHARIDES  (chemically synthesised sugars or sugar derivatives C07H; polysaccharides, e.g. starch, derivatives thereof C08B; malt C12C; fermentation or enzyme-using processes for preparing compounds containing saccharide radicals C12P19/00; production of sucrose C13B)","C07H|C08B|C12C|C12P19/00|C13B","","","","","AldoseAn aldose is a monosaccharide (a simple sugar) containing one aldehyde group per molecule and having a chemical formula of the form C(HO) (n≥3). With only 3 carbon atoms, glyceraldehyde is the simplest of all aldoses.Aldoses isomerise to ketoses in the Lobry-de Bruyn-van Ekenstein transformation. Aldose differs from ketose in that it has a carbonyl group at the end of the carbon chain whereas the carbonyl group of a ketose is in the middle; this fact allows them to be chemically differentiated through Seliwanoff's test.Disaccharide A disaccharide is a sugar (a carbohydrate) composed of two monosaccharides.'Disaccharide' is one of the four chemical groupings of carbohydrates (monosaccharide, disaccharide, oligosaccharide and polysaccharide).HexoseA hexose is a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms having the chemical formula CHO.Invert sugarmixture of glucose and fructose, obtaining by splliting sucrose (hydrolysis) into these two componentsKetose A ketose is a sugar containing one ketone group per molecule.With 3 carbon atoms, dihydroxyacetone is the simplest of all ketoses and is the only one having no optical activity. Ketoses can isomerise into an aldose when the carbonyl group is located at the end of the molecule. Such ketoses are reducing sugars.MonosaccharideMonosaccharides (from Greek monos: single, sacchar: sugar) are the most basic unit of carbohydrates. They consist of one sugar and are usually colorless, water-soluble, crystalline solids. Some monosaccharides have a sweet taste. Examples of monosaccharides include glucose (dextrose), fructose, galactose, xylose and ribose. Monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides such as sucrose (common sugar) and polysaccharides (such as cellulose and starch). OligosaccharideAn oligosaccharide is a saccharide containing less than six monosaccharides. The name derived from the Greek oligos, meaning ""a few"".PentoseA pentose is a monosaccharide with five carbon atoms.Polysaccharide Polysaccharides are polymers containing more than five monosaccharides joined together by glycosidic bonds. They are therefore very large, often branched, macromolecules. They tend to be amorphous, insoluble in water and have no sweet taste. When all the monosaccharides in a polysaccharide are the same type, the polysaccharide is called a homopolysaccharide, but when more than one type of monosaccharide is present, they are called heteropolysaccharides.Examples include storage polysaccharides such as starch and glycogen and structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin.SaccharoseSynonym for sucroseSucroseSucrose (common name: table sugar, also called saccharose) is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose, with the molecular formula CHO. Its systematic name is α-D-glucopyranosyl- (1↔2)-β-D-fructofuranoside (ending in ""oside"", because it's not a reducing sugar).Sugar Sugar is a class of edible crystalline water-soluble carbohydrates that vary widely in sweetness and typically are optically active, including the mono-, di- and oligosaccharides (e. g. sucrose, lactose, and fructose). Sugar as a basic food carbohydrate primarily comes from sugar cane and from sugar beet, but also appears in fruit, honey, sorghum, sugar maple (in maple syrup), and in many other sources. It forms the main ingredient in much candy.In non-scientific use, the term sugar refers to sucrose (also called ""table sugar"" or ""saccharose"") — a white crystalline solid disaccharide. In this informal sense, the word ""sugar"" principally refers to crystalline sugars.","This place covers: Saccharides obtained by hydrolysis of naturally-occurring di-, oligo- or polysaccarides, Glucose; Glucose-containing syrups, Invert sugar; Separation of glucose or fructose from invert sugar, Lactose, Maltose, Fructose, Other naturally-occurring mono-, di- and oligosaccharides, or Production and crystallisation methods."
