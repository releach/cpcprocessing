In Subclass  the criteria for classification derive from the following rules (cf. paragraphs 102. and 133. of the IPC-Guide):Establishing relevant technical information from the document classifiedClassifying this information in a way allowing efficient retrieval.They apply to the classification of new documents as well as documents reclassified during reorganisation.Warning: A large number of documents from the back file do not comply with the present criteria.For efficient retrieval:Most documents should preferably have two or more classification symbols (EC, Indexing Code not necessarily all in ):one symbol to describe the general configuration (preamble type information, field of use), particular of the example(s) given andone or more further symbols are used to identify the special technical features described in the document.In exceptional cases one symbol could be sufficient, e.g. in small groups specifying both types of information or when the general configuration is defined too broad. In this context reference is made to Chapter IX of the IPC-guide.The technical information is to be classified as specific as possible, i.e. as close as possible to the embodiments described.For large documents, e.g. WO-publications based on multiple priorities, multiple symbols would be required particularly in view of non-unitary technical content.However, when too many examples are given a more general classification symbol could be expedient.Apart from the configuration of the subject to be classified per se, particular attention should be paid to the following topics:the materials used,the methods and processes used in making,the half products and parts used andthe field of application.These topics could, apart from classification in an appropriate - group, also be made retrievable by a symbol in the corresponding Subclass when the technical content is considered relevant enough therefore. References to other Subclasses and groups are given below as relationships to other subject matter areas, limiting references relevant for classification and informative references.Further since a major part of documents to be classified have no search report the corresponding sections of the IPC-guide are particular relevant, i.e. IPC-guide paragraphs 124. to 130. combined with the observations in paragraphs 131. to 134.","F16C|F16C|F16C|F16C","Rotary engineering elementAny engineering element, other than a rotating element used in gearing, clutches, couplings or brakes, which rotates so far as its features are affected only by the fact that it rotates.BearingA component of a machine or mechanism that is positioned between two relatively movable elements of the machine or mechanism and that has a surface formed for sliding or rolling contact with these elements when they move relative to each other for the sole function of reducing the friction that would otherwise result from their relative movement.

In general Subclass   it encompasses: elongated mechanical engineering elements for transmitting rotary or linear or combined movement in combination with actuating or driving; mechanical engineering elements to support relatively moving elements (rotating, pivoting or linear movement); construction of rotating bodies in view of load due to movement (centrifugal load). The elongated elements to transmit linear, rotary or combined movement, e.g. push-pull type movement, comprise: Flexible shafts conveying rotary movement (torque); Shafts (torque), telescopic shafts, crankshafts; Cranks, eccentrics; Mechanical means for transmitting movement in a flexible sheathing, e.g. Bowden cables; Connecting-rods or links pivoted at both ends with similar function. The supporting elements allowing relative rotary, linear or combined motion comprise: Axles (to support a rotating body) Crossheads Crankshaft bearings Connecting rod bearings Pivots Rolls, drums, discs Bearings Since the individual mechanical engineering elements of Subclass   are not a coherent group they will be defined individually in more detail below.

One of the parts supports the load imposed thereon by the other part. The bearing is intended to reduce friction between the two relatively moving parts, which are typically larger than the bearing itself. It is noted that apart from bearings many other objects, such as vehicle wheels, conveyor rollers etc., also meet the above criteria. These objects are classified elsewhere. Further it is noted here that in general the expression ""bearing"" is also used for supports between parts which are (quasi) stationary. Due to the lack of relative movement such bearing are not bearings in the sense of this section of Subclass  . Apart from the bearings per se the section ""bearings"" also covers: the direct surrounding of the bearing, i.e. the interaction of the bearing with the two relatively moving parts; the individual parts of the bearing, such as sleeves, rolling elements, races, separators, cages; materials suited for these parts, methods specific for making the parts, as far as they are not covered by other groups, details involving the proper functioning of the bearing such as sealings, lubrication, cooling, damping means, monitoring parts, although not required for the bearing function, which are integrated in the bearing as far as the way they are integrated is of relevance. Bearings are distinguished and classified in the respective groups and groups according to the type of movement they allow principle of operation suitability for load direction. Movement between the two parts: rotary motion (e.g. of a shaft or axle) linear motion (e.g. cross head, linear bearing) oscillating respectively spherical movement combined movements, e.g. helical Principle of operation, i.e. the means to reduce friction: sliding contact, e.g. plain bearings (bushings, journal bearings, sleeve bearings) including: - dry operated sliding bearings relying on material selected to reduce friction (rubbing contact, solid lubricants); - lubricated sliding bearings with lubricant separating parts; - more particular bearings with pressurised fluid (gas or liquid) in the gap between the parts, i.e. making use of low viscosity: -- pressurised by hydrodynamic effect (wedges, pressure generating grooves); -- hydrostatically pressurised by external means; rolling contact, e.g. with rolling elements such as balls or rollers rolling between the parts or rocking motion; fields such as electromagnetic field, magnetic bearings. Loads: radial load axial load combined radial and axial load lateral loads (linear bearings) Combination of principles can be used within a bearing or bearing arrangement, e.g. to support different load directions or to take account of various operating conditions, e.g. speed."
"F16C1/00","Flexible shafts  (flexible shafts in dental machines for boring or cutting A61C1/18); Mechanical means for transmitting movement in a flexible sheathing","A61C1/18","","","","","","This place covers: There are two distinct groups of elements which, apart from being elongated and flexible, have a different function: Flexible shafts conveying rotary motion, respectively Flexible means to transmit push-pull movement. The shaft itself or the transmitting means themselves provide flexibility. It is noted that: flexible shafts are functionally related to shafts (cf.  ) which also convey rotary motion, i.e. are used as drive shaft, whereas ""Bowden mechanisms"" are functionally related to connecting rods (cf.  ) which are also built to transmit push-pull movements, i.e. they are typically used for control-movements. The two groups of elements are thus related to different fields (see limiting and informative references below)."
