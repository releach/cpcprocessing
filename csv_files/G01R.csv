Therefore, a document disclosing a technique of detecting MR using an RF electric field should be classified in this subgroup.: For the purpose of classification in this subgroup, a ""volume type coil"" is to be understood as a coil which encloses the object to be investigated (in contrast to a surface coil which is positioned on a surface of the object to be investigated rather than enclosing the object).: For the purpose of classification in this subgroup, a single-turn solenoid coil encircling the trunk of a patient to be investigated is understood as a volume type coil and therefore classified in subgroup .In contrast thereto, a single-turn surface coil being placed on a surface of a patient is not understood as a volume type coil and should therefore not be classified in subgroup . Rather, classification symbol  (or its subgroup ) should be assigned in that case.: For the purpose of classification in this subgroup, a Helmholtz coil is to be understood as any arrangement wherein two coils are placed symmetrically one on each side of the experimental area along a common axis.Even if these coils are realized in the form of surface coils, the classification symbol  should normally not be assigned. Implantable coils or coils being geometrically adaptable to the sample.This subgroup does also cover coil assemblies with mutually movable parts, e.g. a Helmholtz coil assembly comprising two coils located on opposite sides of the trunk of a patient wherein the distance between the two coils can be adapted to the size of the trunk.However, a single rigid surface coil which is mounted on a flexible mechanical support (e.g. a flexible arm) should not be classified in subgroup . Rather, classification symbol  should be assigned in that case.: An RF coil being inductively matched to the transceiver in the sense that the RF coil is not galvanically connected to the transceiver, but only coupled to the transceiver via mutual inductance or mutual capacitance between the RF coil and a further coupling element (e.g. a driving coil), should not be classified in subgroup . Rather, classification symbol  should be assigned. See comment under .: For the purpose of classification in this subgroup as well as subgroup , the ""function"" of the multiple RF coils is defined in relation to their use for spin excitation, MR signal reception or both.For instance, an RF coil being used for exciting proton spins and another RF coil being used for exciting fluorine spins are therefore understood to perform the same function in MR, namely spin excitation.: This group does not cover fat suppression which is to be classified under subgroup .: This subgroup does also cover the prevention of image distortions.For instance, an RF coil being manufactured from susceptibility compensated wire, thereby preventing image distortions due to magnetic susceptibility variations, should be classified in the appropriate subgroup of , probably using the corresponding Indexing Code ( in the example given above).: This subgroup covers the combined use of at least two different spin resonance techniques, e.g. the combined use of NMR and NQR.This group does not cover RF coils being resonant at two distinct Larmor frequencies.
