""Engine"" also includes the fluid-motive portion of a meter unless such portion is particularly adapted for use in a motor;pumpa device for continuously raising, forcing, compressing, or exhausting fluid by mechanical or other means. Thus, this term includes fans or blowers; machinea device which could equally be an engine and a pump, and not a device which is restricted to an engine or one which is restricted to a pump; positive displacementthe way the energy of a working fluid is transformed into mechanical energy, in which variations of volume created by the working fluid in a working chamber produce equivalent displacements of the mechanical member transmitting the energy, the dynamic effect of the fluid being of minor importance, and vice versa ; non-positive displacementthe way the energy of a working fluid is transformed into mechanical energy, by transformation of the energy of the working fluid into kinetic energy, and vice versa ; oscillating-piston machine a positive-displacement machine in which a fluid-engaging work-transmitting member oscillates. This definition applies also to engines and pumps; rotary-piston machinea positive-displacement machine in which a fluid-engaging work-transmitting member rotates about a fixed axis or about an axis moving along a circular or similar orbit. This definition applies also to engines and pumps; rotary pistonthe work-transmitting member of a rotary-piston machine and may be of any suitable form, e.g., like a toothed gear; cooperating membersthe ""oscillating piston"" or ""rotary piston"" and another member, e.g., the working-chamber wall, which assists in the driving or pumping action; movement of the co-operating membersis to be interpreted as relative, so that one of the ""co-operating members"" may be stationary, even though reference may be made to its rotational axis, or both may move; teeth or tooth equivalents include lobes, projections or abutments; internal-axis type that the rotational axes of the inner and outer co-operating members remain at all times within the outer member, e.g., in a similar manner to that of a pinion meshing with the internal teeth of a ring gear; free pistona piston of which the length of stroke is not defined by any member driven thereby; cylinderspositive-displacement working chambers in general.

In this way, two-stroke engines often provide high specific power, at least in a narrow range of rotational speeds.
