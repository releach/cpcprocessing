The scheme has 4 main branches: The analysis of input signals, output signals, or relationships between them, which are used by the invention in a special way to achieve its goal is classified in  . For instance, if an application analyses a musical signal and turns off ANC if the music is very loud,   should be assigned. The handling of specific non-standard conditions, e.g. detection of instabilities or other malfunctions in the device, or detection of specific signals that must not be cancelled, e.g. speech, sirens or warnings, is classified in  . Inventions about specific details, e.g. specific details of the adaptive filter, hardware or software implementations for lowering power requirements or improving speed, geometric placement of loudspeakers and microphones or combinations with other acoustic elements, are classified in  . The overall ANC circuit structure is classified in  , with the idea of having similar circuits together in one group. For instance, ANC in cars often involves a synthesizer using a reference signal based on engine parameters; as another example, systems in which music is to be played together with the ANC signal mostly have sub circuits that estimate and subtract the music signal from the error signal before the error signal is used to adapt the ANC signal."
