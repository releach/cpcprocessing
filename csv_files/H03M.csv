these codes include in particular Reed-Solomon and BCH codescode shortening or extension for codes other than that, i.e. for codes that are not associated with error location and error correction polynomials, are to be classified under ; these codes include, for instance, Hamming codes or LDPC codesdecoder implementations that comprise a set of data processing elements connected in series, so that the output of one element is the input of the next one and so that the elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashionfor instance, Reed-Solomon decoders are often implemented using a pipeline with 3 stages for syndrome calculation, calculation of the error locator polynomial and Chien search; cf. e.g. US2003140303a cyclic block code with minimum hamming distance d can correct up to (d-1)/2 errorshowever, as long as the code is not perfect, i.e. does not meet the Hamming bound, there exist error patterns with weight greater than (d-1)/2 that can be correctedalgorithms that provide decoding beyond (d-1)/2 errors are to be classified using evaluation of polynomial equations, e.g. syndrome evaluation using a blockwise parallelized Horner schemedirect decoding denotes decoding methods/decoders that do not require the calculation and evaluation of the error locator polynomial by means of complex algorithms like Berlekamp-Massey decoding or Chien searchdirect decoding is limited to small error weights or codes with small minimum Hamming distanceby means of direct decoding the error locator polynomial or its roots or even the error values can be directly determined from the syndromesMethods and arrangements for finite field processing when applied in an encoder or decoder for error correcting codes, e.g. a finite field multiplier.If the finite field processing is not disclosed in the context of error control coding, then this class is not to be given.Methods and arrangements for finite field arithmetic are always to be circulated to .Coded modulation.The subgroups  -  provide details as to the type of code that is used.The type of code can be further refined by using the appropriate Indexing Code or ECLA subgroup; e.g. coded modulation with a Reed-Muller code would be classified using  (coded modulation with block coding) and  (Reed-Muller codes).For a complete classification of a document concerning interleaving, it may be required to allocate more than one subgroup of  to the document. -  relate to different types of interleavers, whereas  -  relate to characteristics other than the type of interleaving.Hence, a document relating to interleaving should usually have a designation of the type of interleaving ( - ) and optionally one or more classes relating to the other characteristics ( - ). indicates that the document deals with interleavers/interleaving for turbo codes (so-called turbo code internal interleavers).This subgroup covers the principle underlying a helical type interleaver for 1-bit dummy codesThis subgroup covers the actual calculation of interleaving addresses.Note that the principle underlying a particular interleaving type may be described without actually providing details about how the address or index calculation is performed or implemented.If a document does not only relate to a particular type of interleaver but provides in addition details about the calculation of interleaver addresses or indices, then this class should be given in addition.Circuits/hardware implementations for the calculation of interleaver addresses or indices.See also the comments w.r.t. .Product codes in which the sub-block comprising the checks-on-checks or parity-on-parity is not present (as it is either not generated or removed).Turbo decoding of concatenated block codes is to be classified in .If the decoding strategy involves iterative decoding different from turbo decoding, e.g. sub-sequent decoding of rows and columns of a product code, then this feature (iterative decoding) is to be classified using .Coding schemes including any concatenation of two or more convolutional codes, wherein decoding is not based on the turbo principle, e.g. serial concatenation of convolutional codes without turbo decoding.If the decoding strategy involves iterative decoding different from turbo decoding, e.g. decoding without exchange of extrinsic soft-decision information between decoders, then this feature (iterative decoding) is to be classified using .Note that  is also to be allocated when a component code is replaced by a non-coded constraint, e.g. turbo equalisation (cf. also the Glossary of terms and the comments on ).Feedback from the channel decoder to a synchronisation unit is used to establish synchronisation with respect to a frame or block of bits.Phase recovery in combination with channel decoding, wherein feedback from the channel decoder to phase estimation is used to achieve or improve the recovery/estimation of the symbol phase.Decoding methods or techniques providing more than one decoding algorithm for one code and selection of the appropriate decoding method or techniqueAdaptive decoding in which decoding is adapted to some extrinsic or intrinsic parameter, e.g. setting of internal thresholds.The extrinsic or intrinsic parameter is the number of estimated errors or information about the state of the channel (e.g. SNR).Initialisation is meant to denote the configuration of the decoder (e.g. setting of internal variables) prior to decoding.Initialisation of MAP decoders for turbo decoding using the result of the previous iteration; initialisation of variable nodes for LDPC code decoding; initialisation of state probabilities for a tail-biting MAP decoder.Note that re-encoding is often performed to estimate error rates but is not integral to decoding as such.For trellis decoding, some bits may be known (e.g. during decoding of concatenated codes, padding bits) to the decoder, which exploits this information as a priori information.The trellis decoder is forced to take the a priori known decision, for instance, by adding to the ACS circuit a decision-overriding logic or by saturating state or branch metrics.This technique is sometimes referred to by state pinning or decision forcing or trellis pruning.For decoding, the optimum code word (in terms of a metric) is searched in a set of possible code wordsThe set of possible code words is often denoted by candidate code wordsThis subgroup includes maximum likelihood or MAP decoding, wherein a list of all code words of the code or its dual code is processed.SISO decoding of block codes with updating of hard decisions of most reliable symbols using extrinsic information from least reliable symbols.Use of properties of the code to be encoded or decoded that relate to its dual code.This includes, for instance, decoding using the trellis of the dual code instead of that of the code itself. and its subgroups:These subgroups are intended to cover the combination of error control coding and other techniques.These subgroups are in particular important when the so-called turbo principle is applied to e.g. demodulation (turbo demodulation) or equalisation (turbo equalisation);

these type of circuits are often applied to encoding and decoding when the operations can be expressed by means of boolean algebra","H03M13/61|H03M13/65|H03M13/00|H03M13/45|H03M13/2909|H03M13/136|H03M13/152|H03M13/00|H03M13/6362|H03M13/6368|H03M13/6393|H03M13/033|H03M13/033|H03M13/091|H03M13/093|H03M13/1114|C|H03M13/1131|H03M13/1134|H03M13/1137|H03M13/114|H03M13/1137|H03M13/114|H03M13/155|H03M13/151|H03M13/618|H03M13/1555|H03M13/1565|H03M13/1565|H03M13/157|H03M13/1575|H03M13/158|G06F7/72|H03M13/25|H03M13/251|H03M13/258|H03M13/251|H03M13/136|H03M13/27|H03M13/27|H03M13/2703|H03M13/2757|H03M13/2771|H03M13/2796|H03M13/2703|H03M13/2757|H03M13/2771|H03M13/2796|H03M13/2771|H03M13/2728|H03M13/276|H03M13/2764|H03M13/276|H03M13/2912|H03M13/2927|H03M13/2963|H03M13/2948|H03M13/2939|H03M13/2948|H03M13/2948|H03M13/2957|H03M13/2957|H03M13/63|H03M13/333|H03M13/336|H03M13/3707|H03M13/3715|H03M13/3723|H03M13/3776|H03M13/3994|H03M13/451|H03M13/456|H03M13/458|H03M13/613|H03M13/63|H03M13/2957|H03M13/6325|H03M13/6331|H03M13/65|H03M13/6569|H03M13/6575","Productmathematical operationTurbo the term turbo denotes the principle that soft-decision information is exchanged in an iterative manner between two decoders or between one decoder and another unit like e.g. a demodulator or equaliser;turbo is also used to denote a code (turbo code) that can be turbo decoded, e.g. a parallel concatenated convolutional code or a serial concatenated convolutional code","This place covers: Encoding, decoding, coding or decoding schemes for the correction or detection of errors, i.e. error control coding (ECC) or forward error correction (FEC) Codes for the correction or detection of errors, e.g. block codes, convolutional codes or concatenated codes Construction or design (including modification of existing codes by e.g. puncturing or extension) of codes for the correction or detection of errors Algorithms, methods or devices for encoding or decoding of codes for the correction or detection of codes Unequal error protection codes or schemes, i.e. codes or coding schemes that provide several levels of error protection Coded modulation for error detection or correction.
