CPC will be updated/corrected once this inconsistency in IPC is resolved.Last place priority rule: Within each group of this subclass, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, classification is made in the last appropriate place.Classification guidance:Subgroups of  are used for compounding ingredients (additives) in admixture with a single polymer only or with a single polymer from a list of alternative unblended polymers.A compounding ingredient in admixture with a single polymer is classified as a single symbol in , and as a C-Set when the nature of the polymer is specified (see Combination-Sets information below).Compounding ingredient(s) in a composition of more than one polymers is classified in the form of C-Sets in  (see Combination-Sets information in ).In this subclass, the following are considered as compounding ingredients:inert additives radical crosslinking agents, e.g. peroxides, S-containing vulcanisation agents coupling agents, i.e. compounds able to improve the adhesion between fillers and macromolecules; or silane compoundsThe following are not considered as compounding ingredients:chemical modifying or crosslinking agents, except silanes, which react via a condensation or addition mechanism are classified with the appropriate polymer (e.g. in , , , ) solvents or dispersion agents for making polymer solutions, emulsions or dispersions () blowing agents ()Modified (e.g. surface-treated) additives should be classified in . Additional information (CCA) should be given for the specific treated additive (e.g. coated silica ()).Mixtures with two or three ingredients are classified in the appropriate groups of , e.g. a mixture of AlO, an ether and an amine is classified in ,  and . -  should be used for classification only for mixtures with four or more essential additives.Ammonium salts are classified in the same way as metal salts. In this subclass, organic acid salts, alcoholates, phenolates or mercaptides are classified in the groups or subgroups of the parent compounds.In the fields  (adhesives) and  (coatings), the additive is classified in  as additional information (CCA). This does not depend on the amount of the additive in the adhesive/coating composition (see Special rule of classification in  and ).Places to classify non-radical crosslinking and chain-extending agents:In  are classified radical cross-linking agents. When the added compound reacts as crosslinking agent or chain extension agent via a non-radical mechanism (condensation or addition mechanism), it should not be classified in . They are principally classified by the type of crosslinking agent or by the type of the chemical modification of the polymer to be crosslinked. These are the places where such compounds in combination with polymers can be classified:For  polymers (polysaccharides): It should be referred to  for each specific polymer.For Diene rubbers (): see .For Vinyl polymers (): In , it should be referred to the chemistry of the modified polymer which is crosslinked.For Polyurethanes (): In , the use of crosslinking agents is classified according to the corresponding chemistry (e.g. polyisocyanates) Carbodiimides as crosslinker can also be found in .For Epoxy resins (): Crosslinking agents are classified in .For Polyesters and polycarbonates ( - ): Symbols in  and  can be given.For Polyethers (): Symbols in  –  can be given.For Other polymers in : Symbols can be given according to the modification of the polymer induced by the crosslinking reaction or the modification of the polymer which allows the linking reaction.Allocation of indexing codes:Orthogonal Indexing Codes  -  are used to specify the role and the physical properties of the additives.Orthogonal Indexing codes may be allocated in conjunction with combination-set symbols. In these situations, allocations of specific indexing codes are indicated with the related C-Sets in C-Sets classification. Breakdown indexing codes in  -  are used as single symbols for classification, but they are not used in forming of C-Set symbols (See C-Sets classification below).Combination Sets (C-Sets):In this subclass, C-Sets classification is applied to the following groups, listed in the table below, if the document discloses a pertinent combination of technical features that cannot be covered by the allocation of a single symbol.

Breakdown and orthogonal index codes are not allowed in the C-Sets either as base symbols or as subsequent symbols.The order of symbols in these C-Sets is relevant as it reflects the presence of one additive and one polymer If a composition comprising one polymer, e.g. polymer X, and two or more additives, e.g. Additive A and B, separate C-Sets are given to each additive and the polymer X, e.g. (additive A, polymer X) and (additive B, polymer X).For a composition comprising one polymer and four or more essential additives, e.g. additives A, B, C, D and polymer X, a C-Set is given using C08K13/yy and separate C-Sets are given to each additive and the polymer X. For example, (C08K13/yy, polymer X), (additive A, polymer X), (additive B, polymer X), (additive C, polymer X), and (additive D, polymer X).If an additive within  is disclosed in admixture with one polymer selected from a list of several polymers, but each of those polymers does not form a blend, all exemplified combinations must be classified as separate C-Sets, e.g. polystyrene or PVC containing a carboxylic amide is separately classified in (, ) and (, ).In the absence of examples, at least one C-Set is given on the basis of sufficient description of the polymer and the additive in the document. If an additive is used in admixture with two or more polymers in a blend, the composition is classified in a form of C-Sets following C-Sets rule in , wherein the additive is assigned as subsequent symbol (see C-Sets #C8Lb).C-Sets examples: #C8Ka: An admixture comprising carbon black () combined with butadiene-styrene rubber () is classified as (, ). #C8Ka: An admixture comprising glass fibers () and resorcinol phosphate () combined with nylon 6, 6 () is classified as (, ) and (, ). #C8Ka: An admixture of styrene-butadiene rubber with carbon black (), sulfur (), silica () and silane coupling agent with sulfide bridge () is classified as (, ), (, ), (, ), (, ), and (, ).","C09|C08K|C08K|C08K|C08L|C08L|C08B|C08C|C08F|C08G|C08J3/02|C08J9/04|C08K9/00|C08K3/36|C08K|C08K3/22|C08K5/06|C08K5/17|C08K13/00|C08K13/08|C09J7/00|C09D7/00|C08K|C09J7/00|C09D7/00|C08K|C08K|C08B|C08B|C08C|C08C19/30|C08F|C08F8/00|C08G18/00|C08G18/00|C08G18/797|C08G59/00|C08G59/40|C08G63/00|C08G63/64|C08G63/91|C08G64/42|C08G65/00|C08G65/32|C08G65/338|C08G|C08K2201/00|C08K2201/019|C08K3/00|C08K13/00|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08K|C08L|C08K|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08L|C08L|C08K|C08L|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08L|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K|C08L|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C08K|C08L83/00|C09D101/00|C09D201/10|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09D|C08K|C09D101/00|C09D101/00|C09D201/10|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09D|C08L|C08K|C09D101/00|C09D101/00|C09D201/10|C09D183/02|C09D183/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09D|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K|C09D101/00|C09D183/02|C09D183/16|C08L83/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09D183/02|C09D183/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C08K|C09D183/00|C09J101/00|C09J201/10|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09J|C08K|C09J101/00|C09J101/00|C09J201/10|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09J|C08L|C08K|C09J101/00|C09J101/00|C09J201/10|C09J183/02|C09J183/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09J|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08L83/00|C08K|C09J101/00|C09J183/02|C09J183/16|C08L83/00|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08L83/02|C08L83/16|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C09J183/02|C09J183/16|C08L83/00|C08L|C08K|C09J183/00|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08K3/00|C08K13/08|C08L1/00|C08L101/16|C08K|C08K5/20|C08L25/06|C08K5/20|C08L27/06|C08L|C08K3/04|C08L9/06|C08K3/04|C08L9/06|C08K7/14|C08K5/523|C08L77/06|C08K7/14|C08L77/06|C08K5/523|C08L77/06|C08K3/04|C08K3/06|C08K3/36|C08K5/548|C08K13/02|C08L9/06|C08K3/06|C08L9/06|C08K3/04|C08L9/06|C08K5/548|C08L9/06|C08K3/36|C08L9/06","AcyclicThe absence of a ring structure.CarbocyclicThe presence of a ring or ring system where all ring members are carbons.CondensedThe presence of two rings that share at least one ring member.HeterocyclicThe presence of a ring or ring system wherein at least one ring member is not a carbon atom.Inorganic compound Compound devoid of a carbon atom and containing a non-metallic element, or a compound containing a carbon atom, and satisfying one of the following criteria: the compound cannot have a carbon atom having direct bonding to another carbon atom, or the compound cannot have direct bonding between a carbon atom and a halogen or hydrogen atom, or the compound cannot have direct bonding between a carbon and a nitrogen atom by a single or double bond.The following are exceptions to the above and are to be considered as inorganic compounds: compounds consisting of only carbon atoms (e.g. fullerenes), cyanogen, cyanogen halides, cyanamide, metal carbides, phosgene, thiophosgene, hydrocyanic acid, isocyanic acid, isothiocyanic acid, fulminic acid, unsubstituted carbamic acid, and salts of the previously mentioned acids and which contain the same limitations as to a carbon atom.Macromolecular compoundNatural or synthetic (co)polymer or resin or rubberMetalAny element other than hydrogen, carbon, halogen (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and astatine), oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, phosphorus, silicon, boron, noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon).Organic compound Compound satisfying one of the following criteria: at least two carbon atoms bonded to each other, or one carbon atom bonded to at least one hydrogen atom or halogen atom, or one carbon atom bonded to at least one nitrogen atom by a single or double bond.Exceptions to the above criteria are: compounds consisting of only carbon atoms (e.g. fullerenes), cyanogen, cyanogen halides, cyanamide, metal carbides, phosgene, thiophosgene, hydrocyanic acid, isocyanic acid, isothiocyanic acid, fulminic acid, unsubstituted carbamic acid, and salts of the previously mentioned acids;
