A further classification is given if the polymers are obtained by reactions forming specific linkages for which an appropriate group is provided.Within each main group of this subclass, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, classification is made in the last appropriate place.In groups  - , in the absence of an indication to the contrary, macromolecular compounds obtained by reactions forming two different linkages in the main chain are classified only according to the linkage present in excess as disclosed in the document.This subclass also covers compositions based on monomers which form macromolecular compounds classifiable in this subclass.If the monomers are defined, classification is made in groups  - ,  according to the polymer to be formed.If the monomers are defined in a way that a composition cannot be classified within one main group of this subclass, the monomers are classified in group .If the compounding ingredients are of interest per se, classification is also made in subclass .Combination sets (C-Sets):In this subclass, C-Sets classification is applied to the following groups, listed in the table below, if the document discloses a pertinent combination of technical features that cannot be covered by the allocation of a single symbol.
