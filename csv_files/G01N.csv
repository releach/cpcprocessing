A typical example is the subgroup  which encompasses protein biomarkers for diseases not provided for elsewhere, thus clearly a rather broadly defined subgroup. In order to further refine the classification of documents in this subgroup, typically additional symbols from the  series are allocated. Of course symbols from this series are also used in other subgroups where diseases are concerned.Similarly additional information symbols from the entire range above are applied to any subgroup to further refine the classification. Normally this would apply more to subgroups with a broader definition. If a specific subgroup already exists in the main trunk the use of additional symbols is not necessary. For example, a document describes a method for detecting a hormone. Classification will be in  only as allocation of an additional symbol for hormones () does not add value (merely duplication).However, if the document were to disclose the hormone to be insulin, classification would be in  and additionally  for insulins. The additional symbol has added value in this case (see also ""Special Rules"" section under subclass .Further symbols from the immunoassay line would also be possible if sufficient detail was present.Special case - many possible alternatives (laundry lists).Documents often disclose lists of alternatives, especially in the area of biomarkers for diseases.

(http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/guide/guide_ipc_2009.pdf).The basic structure and principles of classification are laid out and defined. Particular attention should be given to the presence of Warnings and Notes found at all levels of the hierarchy for .DefinitionsSection: GClass: Subclass: Main group  xx/00Subgroups:  xx/02.  has subgroups with 2-7 dot entries.In such a wide and diverse area as covered by , what criteria are applied and the manner of application form the two main areas to consider.CriteriaIn order to classify an invention/document for search and retrieval purposes, the inventive contribution must first be identified, that is, what does the invention add beyond that already known? The analysis is similar to that carried out in the judgement of inventive step when assessing the contribution to the art. Of course, the objective contribution can only be clearly defined after a search has been made but the claims and the applicant's own description of the prior art in relation to the invention provide a good basis to form an initial opinion. Conventional techniques, standard methods and known reagents do not normally form the basis for the inventive contribution.EXAMPLE: A new antigen is detected by conventional liquid or solid phase immunoassay using homogeneous or heterogenous methods. Classification is based around the antigen, not the methods used to detect it.ApplicationOnce the inventive contribution has been identified, it is necessary to determine which classification symbol(s) to apply. An initial analysis to determine whether chemical analysis of biological matter is taking place, can be quickly made to exclude non- matter. The next step is to decide in which of the two classification branches of  the inventive concept lies i.e, in simple terms, to what extent does the inventive contribution concern a process/device or a reagent/analyte as a group or individual?EXAMPLE: A process/device could be a method for toxicology testing or a dry test strip. A reagent/analyte could be a specific material such as apolipoprotein or a group such as labels, clotting factors, microorganisms, etc.It is very common that the inventive concept may be found to be present in both classification branches.EXAMPLE: The inventive concept lies in the production and use of a label. This subject matter is covered by both - (process/device) and -  (reagent/analyte).EXAMPLE: The inventive concept lies in the production and use of a label. A new means for production of labelled materials takes - as primary symbol but a novel label used in a conventional method for producing labelled materials takes - as the primary symbol.Once it has been decided in which classification branch (process/device or analyte/reagent) the primary inventive contribution lies, the most suitable classification symbol within the branch is identified using the LAST PLACE RULE, i.e the sub group having the highest number of dot entries or last listed in the key of equal dot entry status.EXAMPLES:The inventive contribution lies in a new binding method for testing for HIV. Possible symbols are  (3 dot, binding assay),  (4 dot, microorganisms),  (5 dot, viruses) or  (6 dot, AIDS or HTLV). The correct symbol is .The inventive contribution lies in the use of bilirubin as a serum control standard. Possible symbols are  (3 dot, involving blood pigments, e.g. bilirubin or  (3 dot, involving serum standards). The correct symbol is  as it is the last listed of the appropriate symbols of equal status.With experience, many of the early steps are quickly by-passed. Subject matter that covers a broad spectrum, but gives examples that lie in more than one subgroup are classified in the most appropriate lower dot entry symbol.EXAMPLE: The inventive contribution lies in a new broad spectrum binding method and gives examples comprising testing for HIV, Mycoplasma and Plasmodium. Possible symbols are  (3 dot, binding assay),  (4 dot, microorganisms),  (5 dot, protozoa),  (5 dot, bacteria),  (6 dot, Mycoplasma),  (5 dot, viruses) or  (6 dot, AIDS or HTLV). The correct symbol is  as the inventive concept cuts across the higher level subgroups. The specific antigens tested from the differing microorganisms, could if desired, be identified by use of Indexing Codes e.g.  (HIV antigen).Where the inventive contribution is specific but has no appropriate symbol, the classification symbol of the generalised subject matter is applied.EXAMPLE: The inventive contribution lies in a binding method for a new virus. Possible symbols are  (3 dot, binding assay),  (4 dot, microorganisms),  (5 dot, viruses),  (6 dot, AIDS or HTLV) or  (6 dot, Herpatoviridae). The correct symbol is , a general subgroup for viruses.In order to cover all aspects of the inventive contribution, further symbols from either within the same classification branch of  or from the other classification branch of  should be added. Additional symbols are required in the case of non-unity cases to classify the separate inventions. Consideration must also be given to related symbols outside of the  area, in particular relating to the subject matter of the independent claims.Indexing Codes are used in  to identify specific matter e.g. microorganisms, proteins, sugars, lipids, enzymes, components of analysis e.g. stains, buffers or specific diseases. Their use is NOT compulsory and it is left to the discretion and judgement of each examiner whether to use Indexing Codes or not. It is recommended to use Indexing Codes to highlight subject matter which is significant but is secondary or not covered by ECLA . The use of an excessive number of Indexing Codes per case can reduce their value as a search tool. is not the primary area for applications that contain independent (per se) claims to materials such as chemicals, proteins, antibodies, nucleic acids. These should be transferred to the appropriate area (e.g. , , , , ) with  classification symbols only being applied if subject matter claimed is of particular relevance. Applications containing independent (per se) claims to apparatus where the testing of biological material is not the main inventive contribution should be transferred to the appropriate apparatus areas (e.g. , , , ) with  symbols being applied only when the testing of the biological material is of particular relevance. Testing and analytical methods where the inventive contribution lies in a non-chemical method of analysis e.g. infra-red spectrometry, or material being analysed should be transferred to - .Summary of classification approach:Identify inventive contribution of the applicationDetermine if  subject matter or notDecide whether the inventive contribution lies in a process/device or reagent/analyte. If both, identify where is the main emphasis.Allocate most appropriate symbol(s) using Last Place RuleConsider relevant Indexing CodesConsider related areasScreeningMethods of screening, where possible, are classified under the symbol most appropriate to the inventive contribution.Example: a screening method using T-cells wherein the inventive contribution lies in identifying compounds binding to a GABA receptor is classified under the symbol for GABA ( ) rather than . In contrast, a screening method characterised by features of the method such as use of particular cells or structures, even if only demonstrated by a single example, is classified in the area  - + rather than the symbol relating to the material screened for in the example. If required, an Indexing Code can be used to index the material.Use of 'omic' technologyA recent development in the field of chemical testing and diagnostics is the use of '..omics' technology, i.e. analysis of a large group of similar or related biological molecules wherein expression patterns are used to highlight macro-scale changes, study interactions between molecules or identify markers which may be linked to specific diseases or conditions. 'Omic' technology are regarded as tools for a purpose and inventions using conventional 'omic' technology are classified with regard to the end goal or identified marker. This approach is analogous to the use of monoclonal antibodies.Example: (metabolomics) (glucomics)-  (genomics, proteomics) (lipidomics)Inventions where the inventive contribution lies in the 'omic ' technique itself are classified in the relevant group for the contribution.Example:A proteomic technique where the inventive contribution lies in the use of coating composition to e.g. improve binding of the capture molecules to the solid phase, is classified in .Indexing Code  can be used if it is desired to specifically highlight the use of 'omic' technology.BioinformaticsInventions involving the use of bioinformatic methods may also be classified in the  area. If the inventive contribution lies in the means or method to obtain results which are then processed by conventional bioinformatics, the subject matter is classified in the relevant part in . If the inventive contribution resides in the bioinformatic aspects, the case should be discussed with  which may be better suited to take such subject matter.","G01N33/54366|G01N33/54373|G01N33/5438|G01N33/54386|C12Q|G01N7/00|G01N31/22|G01N|G01|G01N|G01N|G01N|G01N|G01N|G01N|G01N|G01N33/532|G01N33/535|G01N33/58|G01N33/60|G01N33/532|G01N33/535|G01N33/58|G01N33/60|G01N33/53|G01N33/569|G01N33/56983|G01N33/56988|G01N33/56988|G01N33/72|G01N33/96|G01N33/96|G01N33/53|G01N33/569|G01N33/56905|G01N33/56911|G01N33/56933|G01N33/56983|G01N33/56988|G01N33/569|G01N2333/16|G01N33/53|G01N33/569|G01N33/56983|G01N33/56988|G01N33/56994|G01N33/56983|G01N|G01N|G01N|G01N|G01N|G01N|C07H|C07K|C12P|C12N|C12Q1/68|G01N|B01D|B01L|B01J|G01N35/00|G01N|G01N1/00|G01N33/46|G01N33/50|G01N33/9426|G01N33/5047|G01N33/5005|G01N33/5097|G01N33/5023|G01N33/66|G01N33/6806|G01N33/6851|G01N33/92|G01N33/54393|G01N2570/00|G01N|G01N|G16B","","This place covers: Detection of amount/concentration of ethanol in body fluids, e.g. breath, blood."
