Waves may be either electromagnetic waves, which do not require a medium to propagate, or mechanical waves, which require a medium, e.g. acoustic waves. Waves most easily are defined in mathematical terms as obeying a so-called wave equation.Propagation effectsAre relevant if the outcome of a measurement depends on the actual value of a physical quantity characterising the propagation of the wave, i.e. its wavelength, frequency, velocity, or phase. The mere presence or direction of a wave are not considered a propagation effect or to contribute to a propagation effect. To put it in another way, propagation effects are irrelevant, if the radiation may be looked upon as a beam of radiation whose wave nature can be ignored. Examples of measurements where propagation effects are relevant include e.g. measurements of propagation time, phase difference, phase delay, measurements using the Doppler effect, or interference.NavigationIs in this subclass limited to position fixing, or determining the velocity or direction of velocity of vehicles or crafts or their distance from other objects.ReflectionMeans the general physical phenomenon that propagating waves are being scattered by any object, body or target in their path. Scattering can be elastic (i.e. the frequencies of the incoming and outgoing waves are the same) or inelastic (i.e. the respective frequencies are different). Other properties of the wave may change as well. Reflection can be specular or diffuse depending on surface properties of the scattering object. Reradiation further includes the mechanism characteristic of a transponder, i.e. receiving a wave and then transmitting an answering wave.TransponderMeans an arrangement which reacts to an incoming interrogating or detecting wave by emitting a specific answering or identifying wave.Active systemsMeans systems comprising an artificial source for emitting waves. The propagating waves interact with at least one object and are eventually detected by the system. The interaction may consist in e.g. a reflection.Passive systemsMeans systems detecting waves that are not emitted by the measuring system itself (e.g. by the sun).ObjectAn entity that is not part of the measuring device.","This place covers: Methods or apparatus for determining positions, directions and distances by use of radio waves.

Usually, the inventive information present in a publication will relate either to the act of correction, or to reference station and method of sending the correction data to the receiver. Should the subject matter relate to carrying out correction,  should be allocated; in the case of creating the differential data in the reference station or transferring it to the receiver,  should be allocated. It is not uncommon for cooperating elements to provide all or some of the set of acquisition data, differential correction data, integrity data, ranging signals.
