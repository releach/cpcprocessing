Further testing with or about the grown or differentiated cells, e.g. checking for stemness by causing cells to differentiate, assessing the function of the resulting cells, in vitro testing for phar​ma​ceuticals, etc.A document whose examples are solely directed to testing in cells is probably not to be clas​si​fied at all in  but only either in  or  (if emphasis is on the testing itself) or in - (if the intent lies with in vivo therapy after pre-clinical tests).Non-patent literature is not classified, owing to its sheer abundance and to the quality of dedicated databases.Some Principles and PracticesGeneric vs. Specific:  and subgroups are used for general aspects, e.g. ""universal"" culture media or supports, while subgroups of  are used for cell-type specific aspects; thus, classification is gene​rally under , with the appropriate deep Indexing symbol . Examples using com​mon cell types such as 3T3,CHO, BHK (""eucaryotic equivalent of E. coli"") are classified as generic.Stem vs. Differentiated Cells: Classification is based on the end product as available to the skilled person. Documents pertaining to the purification of stem cells are classified as the stem cells; possible examples illustrating the potency of these cells to differentiate are not classified. Documents pertaining to the diffe​ren​tiation of stem cells are classified as the end product in the lower subgroups of , with all applicable symbols - and possibly ; no symbol is given for the starting material, unless the docu​ment also discloses new protocols for its purification and/or maintenance. Docu​ments pertaining to in vivo differentiation of stem cells are classified as the available product, i.e. as (a composition of) stem cells , , , ,  -  , , , , , , , , with the relevant symbol  for in vivo Application; there are no symbols for the resulting differentiated cells.Modified Cells, Fused Cells:  is closed and should not be used; relevant information not related to the genetic enginee​ring itself can be classified in  with an  symbol.The technology classified in  and subgroups (fused cells, e.g. hybridomas , hybridomas for producing a specific antibody ) appears to be mostly obsolete and tech​nically deprecated.The last overhaul in  (from 2002 onwards) was driven by the surge of stem cell-related applications. In order to both keep track of differentiation processes and maintain stem cell groups to a manageable size,  was introduced. It also appeared that, with paperless classification and online search, it would be better to move cell-type specific media and supports to the corres​ponding cell group; - and, later -, were introduced and  documents deeply indexed during reor​ga​ni​sation (- indexing is less thorough because it was actually performed after reorganisation of  was complete). To avoid duplicating in whole the existing hierarchies for proteins (, ), enzymes (), antibodies () and chemicals (, , , etc),  was organised by signalling pathway, so that a ligand, its receptor, anti​bodies thereof and any ""small organic molecule"" with agonist or antagonist activity could share one single symbol.Further cell groups were introduced, with mnemonic letters wherever possible. It has been submitted that the older layers of classification is organised by cell type while the newer layers are often in terms of organs; this is correct, but, taking into account that each different organ is asso​ciated with only a limited number of specific cell types, there should be no ambiguity in practice.Blood and bone marrow-related groups (initially ) were completely remodelled for more specificity, giving an opportunity to get rid of the lymphoid/myeloid distinction which proved to be proble​ma​tic (notably dendritic cells are heterogenous and may derive from both lineages). In order to restrict as much as possible the large group for haematopoietic stem cells, committed progenitors were reclas​sified with their progeny but this policy was not consistently considered elsewhere. (pluripotent adult stem cells) derives from a practical issue, which ultimately stems from our poor understanding of stem cells in general. While stem cells are all the rage, it must be kept in mind that actually very few cells have been proved to be stem: Haema​to​poietic stem cells have only been ""purified"" to a few percent of a population, and that's with mouse cells, not even in humans. Mesenchymal stem cells are currently sourced from various tissues (bone marrow, circulating blood, adipose tissue) which are assumed to yield similar or iden​tical cells; it has also not been demonstrated whether such MSC populations actually contain true multi​potent cells rather than a mixture of various uni- or bi​potent progenitors. Evidence of true stem​ness, at clonal level, is only available for embryonic stem cells; unfortunately, it is also known that ES are a laboratory artefact—a wonderful artefact, but an artefact nevertheless.  was intended as a temporary fix, carefully monitored, to be eventually dispersed into existing groups or better redefined, taking advantage of further insights into ""stemness"".And then induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) appeared, and a specific group was quickly needed to cover this technology.Classification strategy according to subject-matterFor the sake of completeness, classification should be considered in all technical fields where they may be of interest. Common targets for additional classification include: (chemically ""undefined"" pharmaceutical compositions, including cells) (vaccines/immunology), ,  (pharmacy) (gene therapy) (implants, esp. ), and/or  (prostheses) (medical devices), ,  (proteins) (apparatuses for cell culture) (bacteria, fungi) (plants, for documents classified with the symbol  or ) (viruses, including cells for virus culture)(RNAi etc.) (vectors, transgenic animals) (testing), , but also - and - classes referenced therein (analysis and apparatuses)Cells per se, Tissues per se:  but see the important exception for vaccines below.Cells for vaccines, immunologic preparations: e.g. stimulated T cells, antigen-loaded dendritic cells or macrophages according to the antigen, with the relevant symbol .These documents are additionally classified in  only if the invention is directed to the culture process itself and therefore is not adequately described by classification in the field of vaccines alone.Medical preparations containing living animal cells (other than vaccines):, , etc with the relevant symbol  or .Considered for classification in .Transformed cells, Immortalised cells: Quite often, transfected cells are nothing more than a means to produce a protein (, , , possibly gene therapy, ) or to perform biochemical tests or screening assays ( or ): these cases do not deserve clas​si​fi​ca​tion in  and no further  symbol is required. If, and only if, the document is clas​sified in  for another reason or the transformation itself is important (e.g. a cell immor​talised by telomerase, ), an  symbol is used in combination with the  class of the cell type. If the cell type is not relevant, the document pertains to a general method of transfection and should be classified in .Also, claims to a transformed cell isolated from a transgenic animal (possibly made for that sole purpose) need not be classified in  even the cell type is specified: Consider classification in  and add an additional  symbol. The same apply to fused cells (e.g. hybridomas), which are classified in  and subgroups only if their interest goes beyond the antibody they produce (forward to ).Apparatuses for cell purification are not classified at all in ; if the application concerns a particular (novel) reagent, a particular device or a method specifically tied to a particular device, in many cases it will be classified fully outside of .

A cell which is merely claimed without real and exemplified provision thereof shall not be classified in  . This is the case - for example - where the examples only relate to differentiation of a stem cell to pancreatic cells, but where differentiation to hepatocytes or nerve cells is claimed. Then, only the differentiated pancreatic cells are classified. The other cells are not classified at all. CCA (additional information)  -  is compulsory. This relates to any specific and exemplified component of cell culture medium, active agent used in cell culture process, co-culture with or conditioned medium produced by, use of differentiation from one lineage to another or from pluripotent cells, use of cells in diagnostic, methods for the dissociation of cells, genetically modified cells, cells related to new breeds of animals, culture process characterized by the use of forces and support or coating for cells culture characterized by material, topography, treatment or properties. Any such additional information which is claimed but not exemplified is however not to be classified. Cells or tissues in medicinal preparations or for medical uses are classified in  -  irrespective of genetic modification or culture steps. Cells that are medically used after a relevant in vitro culturing step are classified in   and  . Further details of subgroups : TThe highest rank head group is to be used only in desperate cases, for documents which do not fit elsewhere, e.g. culture processes characterised by temperature. : By exception to the dividing line general 00/specific 06, documents describing the modification of membranes of a specific cell type are classified both in   and   and subgroups. : Only generic encapsulation here: Encapsulation of a specific cell type is   (and subgroups),  .   codes may be used for the capsule material. Circulating the document to   and/or   should be considered. Encapsulation in fermenters is  .Note that encapsulated hepatocytes and pancreatic cells have specific subgroups:   and  . : Generic media for potentially any type of cells. Culture processes using a particular agent are treated as a culture medium containing this agent (e.g. use of propranolol in cell culture:  ,  ). All documents should have at least one code from the range  -  , and possibly many of them. Examples using CHO, 3T3, BHK or other common cell types should be regarded as generic disclosure and classified under   rather than under  .  Examples using CHO, 3T3, BHK or other common cell types should be regarded as generic disclosure and classified under   rather than under  . When a new medium is fully disclosed, most if not all   codes potentially apply; codes should be given for any useful information, i.e. any specific component with a specific concentration range (e.g. Ala 20 µ, Pro 10 µ … is indexed  ; reference to a standard composition of essential amino-acids as one component need not be indexed)—which can mean that many codes are actually given, but this appears to be the best way to retrieve reasonably quickly a document with a medium comprising, e.g., 10-100 nM Cu2+ or 20-75 µ Glu. It may not be necessary to index the most common additives (e.g. glutamine) and no code is foreseen for antibiotics, as these appear to be invariably present. : Note that serum-free media for specific cell types are   (and subgroups),  . : By ""negative selection "", it is meant that the document defines what is to be rejected but does not define in any positive manner what is to be retained. The combination of negative and positive markers is regarded as positive selection, and should normally allow to assign a specific type to the cells, and to classify in   (and subgroups). In practice,   and   deal with purging blood or bone marrow (but also, rarely, of other tissues) from, respectively, immune cells and tumour cells before transplantation;   is thus very rarely used. ,  : Documents should have at least one   Indexing Code. Supports for specific cell types are   (and subgroups),  - . : This head group is not used! 06 implies that the teachings apply only to specific cells and it should always be possible to know whether the cells derive from vertebrates or invertebrates. General Considerations: The scope of any sub-group comprises the cells of the title, any tissue explant essentially consisting of these cells (e.g. skin = keratinocytes =  ), processes for isolating these cells (e.g. the definition of a set of markers to isolate a specific cell by FACS, but a document dealing with a specific antibody for one single marker can be classified solely in  ), processes for preparing these cells (culture, differentiation), culture media and/supports specifically adapted for these cells and medical uses of these cells (as far as the nature of the cells is known and is relevant; e.g. medical composition of cultivated pancreatic cells  ,  , ""low-tech"" composition of animal tissue extracts   and subgroups, photochemically-treated blood  ,  ). Controlled language: Title note of  : In this group, the following words are used with the meanings indicated: a ""totipotent"" cell can differentiate into all somatic lineages (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm), the germ line and extra embryonic tissues such as the placenta; a ""pluripotent"" cell is a somatic stem cell which can differentiate into cells of at least two of the three somatic lineages (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm); a ""multipotent"" cell is restricted to one lineage. ""Progenitor"" and ""precursor"" cells are further restricted within the lineage. If not explicitly foreseen, totipotent cells are classified with pluripotent cells. Multipotent cells should not be classified with pluripotent cells. This has been adopted to clarify classification practice with respect to the use of the words ""pluri-"" and ""multipotent."" Under this definition, totipotent cells need to be able to generate placenta and amnion, i.e. only the zygote, blastula and morula cells strictly qualify; applicants tend to use the term more liberally … Conversely, the archetypal example of an adult pluripotent cell in the sense of   (see International Application published under the PCT number: WO 01/11011), has been named ""Multipotent Adult Stem (Progenitor) Cell"" (MASC, MAPC) by its discoverers, which is too restrictive in view of our definitions. Immediate precursors: ""Four dot"" stem/precursor/progenitor groups usually cover (multipotent) stem cells as well as (restricted) precursors and committed progenitors, but there are two important exceptions with respect to the latter: myoblasts go with myotubes in  (since myotubes do not proliferate, culture can only be directed to their precursors). In the blood/immune hierarchy  , immediate, committed, precursors are classified with their progeny;   is reserved for stem cells and multi-lineage progenitors. Sub-headgroups  ,  ,  ,  , etc vs. specific subgroups  ,  ,  ,  : The ""three dot"" (sub)headgroups are used for two different purposes: for cells whose precise type is not (yet) foreseen in the scheme, as a broad indication of end product where the examples do not provide enough evidence as to the result of a differentiation process. E.g. a document pertaining to neural differentiation of BM-MSC is  ,   while a document pertaining to neuronal differentiation of BM- MSC, with detailed, extensive, evidence as to the neuronal phenotype is  ,  . In the intermediate situation where a document claims neuronal differentiation with only limited evidence (e.g. one or two markers), it is preferred to use the headgroup  , especially if the document additionally provides examples of oligodendrocyte/glial differentiation at the same poor level of evidence. : The head group should be used only for specific vertebrate cells which do not fit elsewhere in the scheme. Generic disclosure for vertebrate cells is   (and subgroups). : This is actually ""embryonic or fetal cells and tissues"", but interpreted in a very restricted sense to encompass only cells that are solely embryonic and/or fetal; embryonic/fetal cells of recognisable type which are also present in an adult are classified as adult cells. ""Rejuvenated"" cells claimed to have been brought back to pluripotency or cells described by an applicant as ""ES-like"" do not qualify for  : These cells do not actually originate from an embryo or fetus, see  (A). In practice,   itself only contains embryoid bodies and cells being in an intermediate stage of differentiation between pluripotent cells (ES) and ""adult"" (typable) tissue; e.g. ""definitive endoderm"" cells   (exists only in embryo), pancreatic cells   (adult). Embryonic germ (EG) cells, which can be regarded as an equivalent for ES, are  , but embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells are classified in   as far as they are used as a model for ES (now that human ES have been isolated, EC technology appears to be obsolete). : Pluripotent adult stem cells are still a controversial and largely speculative topic. Extreme care must be exercised when allocating this class: to qualify, a cell must have demonstrated pluripotency (note that the corresponding examples of differentiation into at least two distinct lineages are probably not to be indexed) and must not belong to any other subgroup of the scheme. : This covers all kinds of (demonstrated) ""rejuvenated"" cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). The rejuvenation method/agents are to classified appropriately (  and   for typical iPS obtained by forced expression of Oct-3/4, Sox-2, Klf4, Nanog, cMyc…;  ,  ,   as appropriate for chemical agents). Detailed aspects regarding the construction of a suitable expres​sion vector are to be classified in  . : The head group is to remain empty until a third mammalian sex is discovered or engineered. The few documents dealing both with oocytes and spermatozoa are classified in both subgroups   and  . : For practical reasons, precursors (myoblasts) have been grouped with their progeny (myotubes); as a result, only few documents remain in   (satellite cells). : Owing to the complexity of the lineage, committed precursors are grouped with their immediate progeny: e.g. pre-T cells go with T cells in  ; lymphoid stem cells, which can give rise either to B or T, remain in  . Vaccines: Immunogenic preparations containing T cells or antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells, macro​phages) exposed to antigens, to be used as elaborate forms of vaccines, are classified in   in the first place (most probably  ), with the appropriate   Indexing Code. :  contains purified keratinocytes and whole skin biopsies, assigned to what is regarded as the most relevant cell type, but artificially reconstructed skin is  . ,  : Encapsulation is assimilated to 3D culture.   codes may apply to the capsule material. : For practical reasons, this group contains isolated vascular smooth muscle cells (not  ) as well as elaborated three-dimensional constructs comprising multiple types (e.g. vascular endothelium  , fibroblasts  ); in the latter case, the further cell types may be indexed with   codes as in  . : Haemangioblasts, which are precursors for both the haematopoietic and the vascular endothelial lineages, always get a double class:  ,  . : Tumour cells considered for themselves (i.e. as tumours) are classified here, but tumour cells used as convenient immortalised equivalents / models of their untransformed counterparts are classified as normal cells: e.g. embryonic carcinoma  ; medium specially adapted for hepatomas  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  . : Myeloma cell lines for use in the making of hybridomas are directly classified in  , with their application, rather than as  . : ""Tissue equivalent"" is to be construed broadly as any in vitro construct associating different cell types to achieve one function; the precise structure or function of an actual tissue need not be achie​ved but it must be an artificial construct, not an actual tissue explant (  and subgroups, according to the source or dominant cell type), and no single cell type must be responsible for the desired effect, as is the case for a typical co-culture. Examples: model of neuromuscular junction where a neuron commands a muscle cell  ,  ,  ; testicular prosthesis consisting of chondro​cytes (for shape) and of Sertoli cells (for hormonal function),  ,  ,  ; but embry​onic stem cells on a feeder layer of embryonic fibroblast  ,  .   codes are used to index all cell types, including accessory ones (e.g. vascular cells or tumour cells added in some illustrated embodiments to study vascular or tumour growth inside a tissue).  : Not to be used. Genetic engineering itself is classified in  ; cells modified for a particular appli​ca​tion (e.g. recombinant expression, promoter-reporter constructs for testing) are classified with the application ( - ,  ,  ). Classification in   is done only if there is actual interest in the cell itself; e.g. transfecting pdx1 in MSC to yield insulin-secreting cells (assimilated to pancreatic delta cells, according to the sought therapeutic effect, even though full differentiation and full functionality may not be achieved)  ,  ,  . : Has only been used for extremely rare cases of generic fused cell technology applicable equally to animal, vegetal, fungal (yeast) or bacterial cells. : Fusion partners are not indexed.   covers also cell lines to be used as fusion partners, but not specific hybridomas producing a specific antibody Some ""rejuvenated"" cells prepared by introducing ""young"" cytoplasm into ""old"" cells, or even by trans​ferring ""old"" nuclei into enucleated ""young"" cells"" have been assimilated to fused cells and classified here. See also code  . Note that nuclear transfer in itself is   and circulation is warranted. Proper cloning is not classified here."

Where appropriate, this designation appears in the subgroups in parenthesis. If the information in disclosures is not enough to be able to classify the document in a subgroup for one specific enzyme, classification is done in a higher, less specific, group. This implies that in case of a search for a specific enzyme also such higher groups should be consulted.Besides the enzyme itself also fragments (like epitopes) or derivatives (like mutants) thereof, its proenzyme or just its signal sequence, their encoding polynucleotides or non-coding parts (like promoters, operators) of its gene, including methods for their preparation are all classified in the same subgroup. (antisense DNA or RNA against enzymes )Documents are only classified in main group  and lower if there is more disclosed of an enzyme than just a name, a supplier, a reference to a further document for its production and the like. Properties like a sequence or mutation, or a method for its production etc. must be disclosed.Documents disclosing only lists of sequences with (putative) enzymatic activity are only classified in the last common enzyme group without classes for each mentioned enzyme, unless more information is given than just the sequence with a putative function. For example a long list of sequences comprising only (putative) proteases will be classified in . If there are also lipases disclosed the general class for hydrolases () will be given. A combination with an acyltransferase results in .Documents relating to/being valid for only one specific enzyme, like a mutant of a known enzyme, a new enzyme or a purification method specifically adapted to a particular enzyme, are only classified in the most specific and subgroup relating to this specific enzyme. However, it can also be clear from the provided information that, although the examples concern only one enzyme, the invention is also valid for other enzymes (like a specific purification method only exemplified for a pentosyltransferase but applicable for all other glycosyltransferases). Such documents are both classified in the most specific and subgroup for the enzyme in the examples and in a higher common group (in this case ). (and ) vs. :  (and ) stop where  begins.  (and ) are only used for the product (the inventive non-coding sequence of a gene) while  is used for the use of this product (e.g. a promoter present in a vector for the production of other proteins). Non-coding sequences are only classified in  (or ) if they are (part of) the invention. If the non-coding sequence is just an arbitrary choice from more available sequences it is not classified in  (or )Reporter genes/enzymes like alkaline phosphatase, beta-lactamase etc. are not classified if they are just present for the detection of something else irrespective whether the above prerequisites of sequence, being prepared and the like are fulfilled. If the document however concerns reporter genes with a specifically mentioned property or preparation, classification in the proper group is necessary (fusion polypeptides containing such reporter enzymes are also classified in )Proteins with more than one function, like many receptors which often also have an enzymatic function, or the so called oncogenes, which, besides being tumour related, also have their original function, are classified in all groups concerning their different functions/activities. Depending on the discovery of further different functions older documents may still be present in only one class. Such documents are not systematically reclassified. For search purposes both groups should be consulted.Enzymes prepared by recombinant DNA technology are not classified according to the host used, but according to the original organism from which the encoding nucleotides were obtained, e.g. HIV protease expressed in E. coli is classified with viral proteasesRules for  in addition to : Enzymes are classified additionally in  according to their full EC number (EC a.b.c.d.). An additional  symbol is also allocated even when a subgroup specific for a single enzyme (EC number) already exists in . Thus, thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5), for which a single subgroup, , exists, will additionally be allocated the appropriate  symbol. (This double classification is of potential use for other areas of technology (e.g. food chemistry, detergents) where  classification is used because a more specific classification scheme for enzymes in these areas is not present). A less specific  symbol (e.g. EC a.b.c.) is only used in addition to a  symbol if the subject-matter to be classified concerns a group of enzymes with a common activity AND there is no equivalent group present in  for enzymes with the common activity. For example, a document describes the purification of carboxy-lyases (EC 4.1.1.).  (lyases, EC 4.) is the closest symbol in , thus the document is classified in  and .
