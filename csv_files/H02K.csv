In its general physical construction, this machine is much like an electric motor. The primary winding of the transformer, fixed to the rotor, is excited by a sinusoidal electric current (AC), which by electromagnetic induction causes currents to flow in three star-connected secondary windings fixed at 120 degrees to each other on the stator. The relative magnitudes of secondary currents are measured and used to determine the angle of the rotor relative to the stator, or the currents can be used to directly drive a receiver synchro that will rotate in unison with the synchro transmitter. In the latter case, the whole device (in some applications) is also called a selsyn.On a practical level, synchros resemble motors, in that there is a rotor, stator, and a shaft. Ordinarily, slip rings and brushes connect the rotor to external power. A synchro transmitter's shaft is rotated by the mechanism that sends information, while the synchro receiver's shaft rotates a dial, or operates a light mechanical load. Single and three-phase units are common in use, and will follow the other's rotation when connected properly. One transmitter can turn several receivers; if torque is a factor, the transmitter must be physically larger to source the additional current. In a motion picture interlock system, a large motor-driven distributor can drive as many as 20 machines, sound dubbers, footage counters, and projectorsResolver A resolver is similar to a synchro, but has a stator with four leads, the windings being 90 degrees apart physically instead of 120 degrees. It is considered an analog device, and has a digital counterpart, the rotary (or pulse) encoder. A resolver rotor might be synchro-like, or have two sets of windings 90 degrees apart. The most common type of resolver is however the brushless transmitter resolver, its stator portion houses three windings: an exciter winding and two two-phase windings (usually labeled ""x"" and ""y""). A pair of resolvers could theoretically operate like a pair of synchros, in this case receiver resolvers are driven by transmitter resolvers (the system turns the rotor to obtain a zero voltage in the rotor winding. At this position, the mechanical angle of the rotor equals the electrical angle applied to the stator).Resolvers are mainly used for computation. Both synchros and resolvers have an accurate sine-function relationship between shaft position and transformation ratio for any pair of stator connections. Resolvers, in particular, can perform very accurate analog conversion from polar to rectangular coordinates. Shaft angle is the polar angle, and excitation voltage is the magnitude. The outputs are the [x] and [y] components.","This place covers: Synchros, selsyns and resolvers and other similar devices working in the same ways, i.e. generating and sensing sinusoidal voltages/currents whose phase and amplitude is related to the rotor position.
