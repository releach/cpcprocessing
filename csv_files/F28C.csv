"F28C","HEAT-EXCHANGE APPARATUS, NOT PROVIDED FOR IN ANOTHER SUBCLASS, IN WHICH THE HEAT-EXCHANGE MEDIA COME INTO DIRECT CONTACT WITHOUT CHEMICAL INTERACTION  (safety devices in general F16P; fluid heaters having heat generating means F24H; with an intermediate heat-transfer medium coming into direct contact with heat-exchange media F28D15/00 - F28D19/00; details of heat-exchange apparatus of general application F28F)","F16P|F24H|F28D15/00|F28D19/00|F28F","","","","","","This place covers: Heat exchangers involving heat transfer between different media without separating wall, e.g. cooling towers."
"F28C1/00","Direct-contact trickle coolers, e.g. cooling towers  (building construction E04H5/12; enclosed spaces cooled by trickle F25; components parts of trickle coolers F28F25/00; {indirect-contact cooling towers F28B1/06})","E04H5/12|F25|F28F25/00|F28B1/06","","","","","","This place covers: Heat exchangers in which one medium trickles freely over a material and is brought into direct contact with a cooling medium. e.g. ambient air. Cooling towers are classified according to the type of flow: counter-current, cross-current or both. This group covers also: The use of cooling towers for discharging exhaust gases. Means for recovering heat from exhaust steam. Noise suppressing means. Freezing prevention means. Combination wet/ dry sections (hybrid cooling towers). Means for preventing mist formation above cooling towers."
"F28C3/00","Other direct-contact heat-exchange apparatus","","","","","","","This place covers: Direct contact heat exchangers without trickling of one heat exchange medium, e.g. direct contact between two gases , between two liquids or between a liquid and a gas without or with change of state; one of the heat exchange medium being a fluent solid, e.g. direct contact fluidized bed."
