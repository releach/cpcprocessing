Rolling is a metal forming process in which metal is passed through a pair of rotating rolls for plastic deformation of the metall. Rolling is classified according to the temperature of the metal rolled. If the temperature of the metal is above its recrystallization temperature, then the process is termed as hot rolling. If the temperature of the metal is below its recrystallization temperature, the process is termed as cold rolling. A rolling mill is a machine for plastic deformation of metal between rotating rolls. In a broader sense, a rolling mill is an automatic system or line of machines that performs both rolling and auxiliary operations: transport of the original billet from the stock to the heating furnaces and the mill rolls, transfer of the rolled material from one groove to another, turning, transport of the metal after rolling, cutting into sections, marking or stamping, trimming, packing, and conveyance to the stock of finished product.

Semi- continuous rolling process A continuous arrangement for high-production rolling of almost all products requires the construction of long rolling trains and buildings, but layouts can be shortened by a so-called semi-continuous mill, in which the workpiece is passed back and forth through a reversing mill (see below) before being sent through the rest of the line. Reverse rolling  For difference to Steckel mill rolling, see below. Steckel mill rolling  A Steckel mill is similar to a reversing rolling mill except that two coilers are used to feed the material through the mill. One coiler is on the entrance side and the other on the exit side. The coilers pull the material through the mill, therefore the process is more similar to drawing rolling.
