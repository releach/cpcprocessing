They are divided in two main categories: the subcutaneous access sites () that are implanted under the skin and are therefore invisible to the user; and the transcutaneous acces sites () that actually go through the skin and that therefore have a part exposed to the outside.

Some of the subdivisions of this subgroup mirror the way in which the general connectors are classified in . Other subdivisions are more specific to the medical connectors.This subgroup contains medical check valves that are mostly classified by the way in which the check valve works, i.e. what kind of element (hinged member, flexible disc, ball, stem etc.) is used inside the valve to get the desired ""non-return effect"". Again here, the subdivisions in this subgroup mirror the subdivisions of the group  that contains general check valves.This subgroup contains valve closing automatically on disconnecting the line and opening on reconnection. Part of the subdivisions deals with the way in which the fluid space inside the valve is affected by disconnection. It can be difficult to find that information in the document to be classified, therefore extra-care is required when classifying in this subgroup.This subgroup contains medical clamps for squeezing flexible tubes.
