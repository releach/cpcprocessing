Indexing Codes should be allocated at every opportunity. When classifying milling cutters and milling inserts particular attention should be paid to the Indexing Codes. Indexing Codes should also be added routinely to give details of the workpiece or tool configuration, when this is not implicit in the classification system. For example a document showing a particular tool using machining of a crankshaft may be given a class for inventive information only for the details of the milling cutter. Such a document should also be allocated Indexing Codes relating to the workpiece type, the method of milling and/or further details of the milling cutter itself to allow easy retrieval.The number of 200 series Indexing Codes is too high to list individually. Where the allocation of Indexing Code is compulsory, this is indicated in the templates for the main-group at the sub-group level.An set of drawings is provided under the definition statement for each main group. These drawings illustrate by example the content of the most widely used groups in this sub-class.
