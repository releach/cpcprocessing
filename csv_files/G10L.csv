These techniques are applied to reduce the quantity of information to be stored or transmitted, but are independent of the end-application, medium or transmission channel, i.e. do only exploit the properties of the source signal itself or the final receiver exposed to this signal (the listener). Mainly two types of sources can be distinguished : ""speech only"" encompass signals produced by human speakers, and historically was to be understood as mono-channel, single speaker ""telephone quality"" speech having a narrow bandwidth limited to max. 4kHz. Encoding of speech only sources primarily aim at reducing the bit-rate while still providing fair intelligibility of the spoken content, but not always fidelity to the original. ""Audio signal"" is broader and comprises speech as well as background information, e.g. music source having multiple channels. Encoding of audio deals primarily with transparent, i.e. ""high fidelity"" reproduction of the original signal. The compression techniques can also be distinguished as being : Lossy or Lossless, i.e. whether a perfect reconstruction of the source is possible, or only a perceptually acceptable approximation can be done. The techniques classified in this subclass are based either on modelling the production of the signal (voice) or the perception of it (general audio)."

Coding of a signal with a core encoder providing a minimum level of quality, and extension layers to improve the quality but requiring a higher bitrate.
