In general, the treatment time for therapy is long-term relative to that for surgery which usually has a much more immediate effect on the body.Disabled personA human being that is unable to do a basic physical task (e.g. walking) without assistance due to a physical or mental impairment/condition.PatientA human being awaiting or undergoing any form of (a) medical care (e.g. testing) or treatment by medical staff (e.g. doctors, dentists, midwives, chiropractors) or (b) physical tending (e.g. feeding) by care providers (e.g. hospice or nursing home staff) due to impairment.","This place covers: Apparatus or processes which are not used for surgical purposes utilizing mechanical energy transmitted by direct physical contact with the external surface of the thorax portion of human bodies to induce or supplement normal breathing (e.g. iron lungs). Apparatus or processes, which are not used for surgical purposes that are specially adapted to improve or promote the optical functioning of individuals (e.g. rectify defective vision, improve the natural operation of their eyes) by: contacting eyes or their muscles directly to move the eyes, subjecting the eyes of individuals to controlled muscle strain, utilizing stimulators, such as flash illumination, to cause movement of eyes of individuals in a controlled manner, or facilitating or training individuals through practice to move their own eyes in a beneficial manner. Apparatus or devices that are explicitly designed for use by a single patient or disabled person for the purpose of helping them overcome a physical condition that impairs their ability to walk unassisted across the ground or similar support surface (e.g. crutches). Apparatus or processes utilizing mechanical energy directly applied upon human bodies for therapy (e.g. massage). These therapy apparatus and processes are intended to facilitate the healing of diseases, promote or assist normal operation of a malfunctioning body part, reduce the impact of injuries, or beneficially influence the condition of disabled body parts either by the physical movement of body parts (e.g. devices for exercising a passive body member) or other types of physical stimulation (e.g. touching) transmitted though contact with: external body surfaces or surfaces of naturally occurring body cavities. Apparatus or processes which are not used for surgical purposes utilizing mechanical energy directly applied to human bodies by physical contact therewith (e.g. chiropractic) to treat, alleviate the effects of, or prevent disease or bodily malfunctions (e.g. misalignments of bone, aberrant joint) solely by manipulation, adjustment, or realignment of at least a portion of the skeletal system of the body (e.g. bone joints, tendons, spinal columns) by either: impacting external surfaces of bodies to manipulate or adjust portions of their skeletons containing unbroken bones or pulling or pushing on the external surfaces of bodies to extend or compress portions of their skeletons containing unbroken bones. Apparatus or processes which are not used for surgical purposes utilizing mechanical energy directly applied upon human bodies by physical contact (e.g. massage) to rub, stroke, knead, tap, vibrate, or otherwise move a portion of the external surface of human bodies, or the surfaces of their naturally occurring body cavities, to either: physically relax individuals, physically arouse or stimulate individuals, or counteract or relieve bodily pains. Apparatus or processes which are not used for surgical purposes (e.g. baths) that are specially adapted for covering, soaking, or immersing human bodies, or portions of bodies, within fluids (e.g. steam, water) or fluent materials (e.g. sand, mud) in a manner that is distinct from the common bathing process for cleaning human bodies and is intended to either: counteract or relieve bodily pains, physically relax individuals, promote or assist healing of injured bodies or their parts, or restore to health, or alleviate the effects of sicknesses or other types of abnormal conditions on, bodies or their parts. Apparatus or processes (e.g. breast baths) specially adapted for covering, soaking, or immersing only one particular part of the human body within fluids (e.g. steam, water) or fluent materials (e.g. sand, seaweed). Articles of clothing (e.g. sweating suits for therapy) that at least partially enclose human bodies for the primary purpose of increasing the local temperature (e.g. insulated, include heating elements) or humidity (e.g. constructed of partially air tight material) of the portion of the human bodies covered to a point where the localized temperature or humidity is beyond the range that human beings normally consider physically comfortable (i.e. creates localized sauna-like environment) for therapy. Specially adapted components for the above types of apparatus. Auxiliary appliances or accessories specially adapted for use with any of the above types of apparatus or process (e.g. reflex point locators). Other types of apparatus or processes which are not used for surgical (e.g. acupuncture devices) purposes that utilize mechanical energy directly applied to human bodies by physical contact for improving their functioning that are not specifically provided for elsewhere in another subclass."
