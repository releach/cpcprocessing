A picture (a photo or print, drawing, etc.) is placed beneath it, with the cutout framing it. The passe-partout serves two purposes: first, to prevent the image from touching the glass, and second, to frame the image and enhance its visual appeal. The cutout in the passe-partout is usually beveled to avoid casting shadows on the picture.squeezingmeans to compress the material in a locally limited area (e.g. by a rounded edge) to such an extend, that the material is displaced and hence tensional stress is produced to such an extend that the material is severed.","This place covers: Perforating, punching, cutting-out, stamping-out; severing, by means other than cutting, non-metallic sheet material or metal foil in general; severing, by means other than cutting, other forms of non-metallic materials not otherwise provided for."
