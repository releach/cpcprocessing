The term ""similar in form and in manner of use to thread cutting tools"" of   should be strictly interpreted. The forming tool being used should bear a very close resemblance to known cutting tools. Examples of such tools are forming taps (roll taps i.e. a tool similar to a cutting tap, rotated on its own axis and fed linearly with feed per revolution equal to thread pitch), and forming tools resembling milling cutters rotated on their own axes and used with a helical feed in which the pitch of the helix corresponds to that of the thread being produced. Although these are the most common examples, the use of thread-forming dies, similar to in form to thread cutting dies or indeed any tool falling under the term, ""similar both in form and in manner of use"" that isn't classed elsewhere in ECLA can be classed here.
