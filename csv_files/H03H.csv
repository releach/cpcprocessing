For example, the normally negative temperature coefficient of AlN (-25 ppm per deg C) and ZnO (-60 ppm per deg C) can be offset to a degree by the positive coefficient of silicon dioxide in film form (+85 ppm per deg C).The documents classified in  relate to bulk acoustic wave devices with means for compensation of reflections.The aim is to prevent unwanted vibration due to non horizontal vibration leakage, thereby suppressing occurrence of spurious components.The documents classified in  relate to bulk acoustic wave devices with means for compensation of stress.The aim is to prevent stress in order to avoid:internal stress by having it evenly appliedformation of cracksOne possibility is the use of low tensile stress material.The documents classified in  relate to bulk acoustic wave devices with means for compensation of electric discharge due to pyroelectricity.The documents classified in  relate to bulk acoustic wave devices with means for compensation of ageing changes, e.g. atoms diffusion.The aim is to prevent the problem of chemical interaction between two metals and specially the migration of atomic charges from one layer to an other (electromigration).To avoid migration between different layer of a multiple layer electrode.To avoid migration between the piezoelectric layer and an electrode layer, a diffusion barrier, or a barrier layer is provided.Electrode corrosion or oxidation, due to humidity (air contact) has also to be classify here.There is provided a protective layer or a passivation layer in order to protect the electrode.The classes + accommodate documents disclosing particular reflective or coupling entities for both SAW resonators and SAW filters.Note:Seen the relatively high degree of indentation it is meant to keep the root rather empty.Redundancies:1)  appears to overlap the classes +. From now on, no new documents should be classified in . This class will be deleted in the future and the documents still in there will be reclassified accordingly (it is expected to move most of them in +)2) Idem for the SAW documents in , , . These classes are already cleaned out now of any SAW devices.BAW and MEMS are still to be classified in these classes and their subclasses if needed.3) The is a certain overlap between  and + concerning in particular the reflective/pulse array compressors (RAC, PAC). Currently this overlap is not an issue, as apparently no new docs enters.Reflector gratings are replaced with dot arrays better performing from the point of view of e.g. spurious/ripple.For example, GB2060305 says:""In most applications it is desirable to vary the strength of reflection from different grooves or strips within the array to provide amplitude weighting, and in the case of metallic strip array this cannot be done in a simple controllable manner.To overcome this limitation of metallic strip arrays, while retaining its advantages, it has been proposed to replace each reflective metal strip with a row of metallic dots.""US4204178GB2060305US3886503The grooves could be empty, partially or totally filled with material, and they could be between (but not inside) IDTs or side-framing them. When they are inside the IDTs, should be allocated.US4237433US4204178The grooves could be emptied of filled with material and should be only inside the IDTs.US4454488US4130813US2004095038SAW devices having no grating reflectors, but edges cut at the appropriate position in order to produce the reflection of the waves launched by IDTs and therefore to define a resonant cavity to which the SAW waves are confined.It to be noticed that the former name of this class (originally under ) was changed by removing from the list of examples the shear horizontal (SH), shear transversal (ST) and Love waves for which it is not granted that one has an edge reflective arrangement.EP1030445US5781083Edge reflecting SAW devices whose propagation substrates have complex cutting at the reflective end in order to improve parts of the frequency characteristics (e.g. side lobe suppression, ripple, etc.).WO2005050836US2003034859 US2003071539US5287036The class accommodates documents disclosing particular reflective gratings for both SAW resonators and SAW filters.When the reflector shape is apparently a common one, but is however of importance for the subject-matter of the document (e.g. dimensions and positioning of the reflector is of great importance for the inventions like in JP57063920, below), the document should also receive :JP57063920""Non-standard"", complex shapes of reflective entities would also get a class in :US4210883US2004075511JP61061512The class accommodates documents disclosing partially circular, elliptic, hyperbolic, or more generally curved shapes.US4013983US4038614CA966588The class accommodates documents disclosing U-, V- or round L-shaped grating linesCA966588US2004096139DE4228223US4468642JP61004316JP55153418The class accommodates documents disclosing grating lines which are piecewise linear, but not straight. These kind of reflective arrays improve the broadness of the band and reduce dispersion. See for analogy the corresponding class under  for shifted transducers (currently the right entry in  could not be given due to reorganisation works in there).GB2175477US2004096139US2003193668The class accommodates documents disclosing tilted, fan shaped or slanted grating lines. Sometimes the docs should be classified in the chirp reflectors class, too.WO9717757US4801836DE3731309US4801836 (see comb like gratings 16)(see comb like gratings 54, 55)The comb like reflectors have a median short circuiting line:US2004096139EP1926210Grating lines are floating or grounded and disposed inside the IDTs:JP60263505WO8002090EP1463200Grating lines of meander form are floating or grounded and disposed inside the IDTs. Apparent overlaps subject-matter of  (polyphased IDTs), but there the meandering electrode(s) are connected to a hot wire phase (i.e. neither grounded nor floating).XP000977542US2003067370EP0337703The reflectors on the left and right side of the (filter) resonator are electrically connected on the substrate via a comb electrode which is part of the IDT (and obviously connected to ground or floating) (see US5363073), or via an intermediate reflector disposed inside the IDT arrangement (EP1276236), or otherwise (XP000439202).EP1276236US5363073Sometimes U-shaped reflectors are ""eligible"" for the present class, too:XP000439202Reflector banks contain more than two reflective patterns in the same reflector unit, or the reflector unit has of at least two separated groups of identical patterns reflectors, which are mutually spaced.CA966588XP008032241US4340834Continuous, ""massive"" (most of the times) metallic or electrically conductive deposition which is meant to reflect the SAW waves to a certain direction, and to attract the skimming component of the waves to the surface and therefore improve the directivity and frequency content of the surface acoustic waves by reflections and self cancellation of harmonic components.It has not to be confounded with wave guides which have the dominant dimension (let's call it length) oriented in the direction of propagation of the useful SAW (see ).GB2000409DE4313981EP1926210Sometimes the conductive deposition mentioned in  also has the role of focusing the surface acoustic waves in order to reduce the dispersion or simply to direct it to (usually) output IDTs.

Often the disposition of the IDTs is a plane-rotated or a diagonal one, which makes them also classifiable in  .Chirp is necessary for compression/decompression of the waves () which makes them suitable for radar applications () or computing correlators, convolvers (), for example:US5113115 (correlator)GB2114393 (compressor)Broad band applications (some of the documents are still in ) use also chirped structures:JP53144646Chirped is also used for reducing the negative effects (e.g. side lobe or ripple) of the imperfect radiation of the transducers (dispersion):JP61032610It should, however, hot be confounded with matched SAW devices usually used in spread spectrum coding/decoding and for which the KW09 64m matched filters ()was created:JP61136314A wide band SAW filter using slanted transducer fingers has an advantage that the insertion loss is small, with respect to a SAW filter using the apodizing method or dispersion type electrodes. However, although the central pass band characteristics are adequately flat, it is generally inclined with frequency.Some examples:RU2171010XP010612643When the fan shape is a curved one, the next classification entry  and  takes precedence. For example, the following arrangement alone does not entitle the document to be classified under the present classification entry but on ""Arched, Curved or Ring Shaped Transducers"":WO9710646 (incidentally, for this doc. another arrangement made it eligible, however for )For a document to be classified in this entry it is enough to disclose a curved shape of at least one of the fingers.Some examples:DE102005009359XP000208195USRE27116EFR2623348 (see finger 83)US4908542Exceptions are documents showing IDTs disposed on 3D surfaces, like (these documents are classified in the root - ):US2007241639EP1453199The class should contain only documents disclosing IDTs with bent asymmetrical fingers (i.e if one draws an axis in the middle of the IDT, parallel with the stretching direction of the fingers, the IDT would not be symmetric w.r.t. to that axis. For the symmetrical bent fingers  takes precedenceOne of the achieved goals is reduction of TTE (triple transit echo) which makes the class close related to (1):JP55112022Phase coding in telecom or ID-tags is another application:US3931597Some other examples:DE19943072EP1619794If in the fan like shape the fingers are stepped the document is to be classified here. The resultant effect is a superposition of the individual effects/radiation/excitation/frequency characteristics of the serially connected elementary IDTs (in US3727718: Fig. 3 below - 52, 53, 54, 55). Possible utilization in broad band devices is foreseen. For some applications, however, the superposition is not as important as squeezing of IDTs on the same piezoelectric surface, at the end the radiated mechanical wave being captured by individual IDTs specialized on specific bands (e.g. US3727718 below).US3727718Some other examples:RU2171010US2004108917As the title suggests, along the finger length, the width of the finger varies (mostly stepwise).Some examples:EP0585863EP1274169the shape of the IDT gets pointed at the extreme end of the acoustic propagation track, and often one of the bus bars of the IDT is continued outside the IDT in the propagation direction and there formed in a shielding reflector with an tree like structure.US4513262EP0092290JP59125113EP0103932The present sub-class accommodates documents disclosing relevant aspects concerning the last finger-electrodes of IDTs, and namely IDTs having only the last finger-electrodes different from the remaining fingers in the IDTs.The document, anyhow, would receive a class in + or + if the filter structure is of importance (i.e. not trivial).The present sub-class accommodates documents disclosing relevant aspects concerning the last finger-electrodes of IDTs, and namely IDTs having only the last finger-electrodes of a special different from the rest of the IDT fingers.The document, anyhow, would receive a class in + or + if the filter structure is of importance (i.e. not trivial).EP2066026EP0088400US2007024397The present sub-class accommodates documents disclosing relevant aspects concerning the last finger-electrodes of IDTs, and namely IDTs having only the last finger-electrodes split.The document, anyhow, would receive a class in + or + if the filter structure is of importance (i.e. not trivial).EP1175006WO0039925One of the IDTs in the filter is split into two longitudinally coupled electrically connected IDTs in order to cope with necessary impedance match (mostly used in balun devices).WO2007049754One of the IDTs in the filter is split into two stack like arranged IDTs in order to cope with necessary impedance match (mostly used in balun devices).GB2387495Basically this geometrical shape was adopted in order to increase the efficiency of the SAW filters by reducing the insertion loss. As a bonus, the ripple is also reduced. Some applicants bring as an (additionally) solved problem the compensation of the variation with the temperature of the frequency characteristics (e.g. US4379274).Phenomena: Piezoelectric substrates have anisotropic characteristics, and the excitation efficiency is negatively affected by the propagation direction of the surface acoustic wave. As shown in US2007046394, the excitation efficiency is reduced by the deviation (dispersion) of the propagation direction of the surface acoustic wave from the direction perpendicular to the fingers.As a consequence the output IDTs do not to ""catch"" all the SAWs emitted by the input ones and the insertion loss increases.As a solution a plane rotated IDT (somehow one side slanted as in the figure below) brings an improvement by increasing the ""amount"" of the received waves.Some examples:US6373353EP1542361 - plane rotated IDT/resonator.The documents classified in  relate to single resonators consisting of piezoelectric or electrostrictive material.A resonator is a one port device having two terminals, whereas a filter is a device having at least two ports.For example, this is a resonator:but this is a filter:A resonator presents a frequency response like this:fr being the resonance frequency and fa the anti-resonance frequency.Details of bulk acoustic wave devices (e.g. vibration mode, dimensional parameters, characteristics of piezoelectric layers, treatment of substrate, compensation of undesired effects) are classified in +.Piezoelectric resonators implemented with thin-film techniques are classified in +.Piezoelectric resonators comprising a ceramic piezoelectric layer are classified in .Piezoelectric resonators of the energy-trap type are classified in .Piezoelectric resonators comprising a laminated structure of multiple piezoelectric layers with inner electrodes are classified in .Note:There are no documents classified in  as there is no use of this class for the moment.There are various resonator structures which are classified in , as for example:Cantilever Resonators:These documents should be provided with the following keyword:09 baw cantilever resonators ()Lateral Field Resonators:In lateral-field excitation resonators a single pair of electrode is formed on a surface of the piezoelectric plate. The electrodes are separated by a narrow gap across which is generated an electric driving field by the application of an excitation voltage applied to the electrode extremities at the peripheral edge of the piezoelectric plate.And a lot of other types:The documents classified in  relate to resonators implemented with thin-film techniques presenting a structure which comprises no means for mounting on a substrate (see +).The group contains a lot of different resonator structures implemented with thin-film techniques, as for example:The documents classified in  relate to resonators implemented with thin-film techniques with emphasis on the means for mounting on a substrate.There are a lot of possibilities for mounting a thin-film resonator on a substrate, different from the one associated to the air-gap type (see ), the membrane type (see ) and the acoustic mirror type (see ), as for example:Suspended thin film resonators (STFR) or resonators having a bridge structure:Most of the microelectromechanical resonators (MEMS) comprising a piezoelectric layer:For more details about piezoelectric mems, see Note on FBAR versus MEMS.Overmoded resonators (see also ):And a lot of other resonators:Note:The last figure has also to be classified in the keyword 09 baw cantilever resonators ().The documents classified in  relate to air-gap type resonators.In the air-gap type resonators, there is a cavity formed between the resonant part and the substrate.This cavity is often formed by etching a sacrificial layer (also called temporary layer).Forming a cavity under the resonant portion is one way of confining the bulk acoustic waves to a volume usually comprised between the overlapping area of the electrodes, i.e. of providing the required acoustical isolation between the resonant structure and the supporting substrate.It has to be noted that structures with the cavity inside the substrate have also to be classified in , as for example:Note:If details about membrane and/or mirror type resonators are provided, the document should also be classified in  and/or .The documents classified in  relate to membrane type resonators.In the membrane type resonators, there is a cavity (a via hole) formed under the resonant part through the substrate.Forming a cavity under the resonant portion is one way of confining the bulk acoustic waves to a volume usually comprised between the overlapping area of the electrodes, i.e. of providing the required acoustical isolation between the resonant structure and the supporting substrate.There are two main types of membrane resonators (both classified in ).1/ Edge supported membrane resonators:The resonating structure comprises, in the cavity area, a piezoelectric layer which is supported on the substrate by its edges.These membrane resonators are further characterized by a direct interface bottom electrode / air.2/ Composite membrane resonators:The resonating structure comprises, in the cavity area, a piezoelectric layer which is supported on a non-piezoelectric layer (e.g. a semiconductor or dielectric layer).These documents should be provided with the following keyword:09 17a1b composite membrane ()A last detail applicable to the two types of membrane resonator is the bottom side metallization.The metallization forming the bottom electrode of the resonator completely covers the bottom surface of the membrane in the cavity area, and extends in a seamless way so as to cover also the adjacent walls of the substrate defining the cavity.These documents should be provided with the following keyword:09 13 bottom side metallization ()The last figure represents a composite membrane resonator with the bottom side metalization. So it has to be classified in  and under the two keywords described before.This last membrane resonator presents a bottom side metallization but is not a composite membrane resonator, as the dielectric layer is not present in the resonant part.Note:If details about air-gap and/or mirror type resonators are provided, the document should also be classified in  and/or .The documents classified in  relate to mirror type resonators (aka solidly mounted resonators).In the mirror type resonators, there is an acoustic reflector (aka acoustic mirror, Bragg reflector...) composed of alternatively arranged high and low acoustic impedance layers. Usually the thickness of these layers is λ/4 or λ/2. The acoustic reflector is disposed between the resonant part and the substrate.Forming an acoustic reflector under the resonant portion is one way of confining the bulk acoustic waves to a volume usually comprised between the overlapping area of the electrodes, i.e. of providing the required acoustical isolation between the resonant structure and the supporting substrate.If he alternating laminated layers of high and low acoustic impedance are disposed on top of the top electrode, the document should not be classified in  but accordingly to the other characteristics of the structure of the resonator, as for example:Note:If details about air-gap and/or membrane type resonators are provided, the document should also be classified in  and/or .The documents classified in  relate to single resonators comprising a ceramic piezoelectric layer, which is polarized.This polarization is required in order to exploit the specific piezoelectric properties of the ceramic piezoelectric layer.Note: and  take precedence over .There are two groups of ceramic materials:* Non spontaneous polarized materials:Ta2O5, (Ba,Sr)TiO3 (BST), LiTaO3 (lithium tantalate), LiNbO3 (lithium niobate), AlN (aluminium nitride)* Spontaneous polarized materials:Ferroelectric:Ferroelectrics exhibit a spontaneous dipole moment which can be reoriented.Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT, lead zirconate, lead titanate), SrBi2Ta2O9(SBT), perovskite type.Antiferroelectric:Antiferroelectrics have antiparallel dipoles which can be transferred into a parallel state (ferroelectric state) under an applied field.

However, it can not be avoided that this energy propagates outside this virtual volume, resulting in an increase of the insertion loss (see last figure).In the last figure, the vibrating part is at the center, and then we have reflective layers and holding members.Documents classified in  relate to single resonators comprising a laminated structure of multiple piezoelectric layers with inner electrodes.Note: takes precedence over .The electrode layers and the piezoelectric layers, which are made of ceramic materials are alternately stacked. (see definition of  for more details about ceramic materials)The stacked piezoelectric layers are interleaved with electrodes.

Farrow implementation: XP001019533 Based on splines: EP1313219 the transfer function for the LP filter is approximated by a set of polynomials (splines). In Fig. 4, 4 polynomials are represented each polynomial (45 - 48) corresponds to an interval of 1 pixel. Only the coeffs. of the polynomials piecewise approximating the transfer function of the filter are stored in memory, the coefficients are calculated on-the-fly from the coefficients of the polynomials for any phase difference. (This is understood according to XP1019533 as: some info. corresponding to the coeffs. must be initially stored; this is the coefficients, i.e. samples of the impulse response h(t) which mark the starting points of the individual polynomial pieces -> for this reason this document is classified in ON-LINE COMPUTATIONS and not in PRE-COMPUTED)"
