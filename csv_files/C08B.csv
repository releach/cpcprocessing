A glycosidic bond is formed between the hemiacetal group of a saccharide (or a molecule derived from a saccharide) and the hydroxyl group of some organic compound. If the group attached to the carbohydrate residue is not another saccharide it is referred to as an aglycone. If it is another saccharide, the resulting units can be termed as being at the reducing end or the terminal end of the structure. The reducing end of the di- or polysaccharide is towards the last anomeric carbon of the structure, and the terminal end is in the opposite direction.One distinguishes between α- and β-glycosidic bonds based on the relative stereochemistry of the anomeric position and the stereocentre furthest from C1 in the saccharide. In D-hexose sugars in their pyranose forms, an α-glycosidic bond is formed in an axial orientation, whereas a β-glycosidic bond will be oriented equatorially.","This place covers: Polysaccharides per se or their derivatives, with six or more repeating units, i.e. saccharide radicals attached to each other by glycosidic linkages.
