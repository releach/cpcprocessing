Classification is obligatory.Further details of other subgroups of : Beam splitting or combining systemsThe scheme comprises subgroups covering specific structural technical solutions (""means"") and a parallel set of subgroups covering the purposes of the devices, independently of the specific type of beamsplitter used.The subgroup  is intended for beamsplitting/combining systems which cannot be given any lower means subgroup in the scheme. In general, documents should be assigned at least one means subgroup and at least one purpose subgroup.Purpose Subgroups: Examples for splitting or combining different wavelengthsFor wavelength specific documents which are not covered by any lower entry.All color imaging related documents are in the color sensing subgroup () or in one of the color reproducing subgroups ( and subgroups). These subgroups are not limited to RGB devices and cover also non visible or pseudocolor devices as long as the final image is intended for the human viewer.For color or multispectral image sensors, e.g. splitting an image into monochromatic image components on respective sensors.The devices must be imaging devices, including line scanning. Other spectral sensing devices belong to .For generating a color image from monochromatic image signal sources.Essentially covers color generating systems not specifically designed for a particular type of SLM, e.g. illumination systems combining multiple light sourcesFor use with reflective spatial light modulatorsWO0038432US2001000973Having a single light modulator for all colour channelsFor use with scanning systemsBeams splitter/combiner arrangement for color scanning display arrangementsFor use with transmissive spatial light modulatorsThe ""classic"" 3 LCD projector;Using a single light modulator for all colour channelsfor example time sequential led sources used with a single SLM, US2006196944could be extended to light pipes: EP1003064For splitting or combining a plurality of identical beams or images, e.g. image replication.Quite a few documents deal with obtaining multiple identical copies of a beam.

Sampling devices for high power laser, laser beam insertion.US4746205GB2027222Means Subgroups: ExamplesThe decisive criterion is the physical principle leading to the splitting or combining, and not other aspects of the device. For example a cube beamsplitting prism operates by reflecting (part of) the beam, and hence operates by reflection, even though it also has refracting surfaces. Following the optical path, the relevant surface marks the boundary between the single beam and the multiple beams.IPC classes  and  refer to ""refraction only"" or ""reflection only"" but some devices use both reflecting and refracting beamsplitting structure, e.g. US6400512 :Applying strictly the IPC wording of the headers  or , such documents would not have their details classified in these subgroups.

An example of such a display is shown in the figure belowConcerns volumetric displays, i.e. in which an image is built up from image elements distributed over a three-dimensional volume. An example is US2007/0242324, in which visible fluorescence is excited at the crossing points of two scanned invisible lasers:There are three subgroups:The image being built up using a stack of two dimensional planes, e.g. US 2002/0130820:The volume being generated by a moving (vibrating or rotating) surface, e.g. US6115006:Projecting an aerial or floating image, typical examples of which would be WO02/061492:or WO95/19584: Diffraction optics deals with systems comprising a DOE (diffractive optical element) having a significant interaction with another component of the optical system.

This subgroup contains documents in which the diffractive effect results from a purposeful design of a DOE. It does NOT include documents in which light is merely diffracted by an aperture, an edge or a particle.  is an exception to this rule.  is essentially structured into two major groups:.. imaging systems ( and lower).. non-imaging systems ( and lower).Besides this major differentiation, there are three further divisions:.. physical properties of the DOE:polarization ,thermal ,spectral , .. sequential DOEs  and .. theory, models In deciding whether a system is an imaging system or a non-imaging system, concepts such as image resolution or extended objects/images are strong hints towards imaging systems. On-axis point-like objects/images are pointers to non-imaging systems. It is important to note that  (and lower) and  (and lower) relate to the specific role played by the DOE in the system: a DOE within an imaging system, but merely deviating light for illumination purposes in a subsystem of the imaging system, is classified in  (or lower).Specific rules (and lower) should preferably not contain documents which have a more specific class e.g.  (optical fibers, waveguides),  (laser pulse compression),  (spectroscopy). should contain no document from the field of optical pick-up devices (these documents should be classified in ). should preferably contain no document about mask illumination in a lithographic apparatus (these documents should be classified in ). This should not be confused with a DOE projecting an image of the mask onto a wafer, which is classified in ). and  relate to plural diffractive elements positioned sequentially along the optical path means that the distance between sequential diffractive elements is large enough to ensure that each period of the subsequent grating receives diffracted light from several periods of the previous grating, i.e. far-field diffraction. For instance, DOEs which, at least in certain portions of the DOE are in direct contact or multilayered DOEs are normally not plural diffractive elements in the sense of  and .When allocating , consider also the relevance of the following classes in  relating to diffraction or gratings: (photonic crystals) (moth-eye anti-reflection structures) (diffusers using holographic or diffractive means) (diffraction gratings per se) (filters using holographic or diffractive means) (holographic optical elements) (controlling direction of light) (scanners using movable diffraction gratings) (beam shaping using diffractive optical elements) (beam splitting and combining by diffraction) (spatial filters) (superresolution, apodization) (systems using moiré fringes)Exemplary drawings for Diffraction optics, i.e. systems including a diffractive element being designed for providing a diffractive effect ( takes precedence) having a diffractive optical element [DOE] contributing to image formation, e.g. whereby modulation transfer function MTF or optical aberrations are relevant e.g. WO2008081070: microdisplay (110) projected by diffractive beam expander (50)correcting chromatic aberrations (, ,  take precedence)  e.g. US6130785: eyepiece (800) with diffractive surfaces (28b, 29b) correcting geometrical aberrations e.g. US2002027712: L6 comprises DOE;
