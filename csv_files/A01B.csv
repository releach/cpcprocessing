Some of these parts, tools, or methods may not refer directly to a blade for working the soil, but will be however directly related to the soil working action, like guiding the machine to work the soil according to a planned path or at a constant depth (which are related to steering, to the connection/hitch to the tractor, etc). Double classification in other classes, like in , is allowed depending on the precise details (see the lower classification in  and ). For instance, a coulter for a seeder which has a seed pipe attached, the coulter having no specific description (no detail relevant for the soil working classification scheme), will only be classified under . However, a coulter for a seeder, even if it includes a seed pipe, whose action in the soil is described in detail or has some special feature for working the soil (opening the furrow) is/may be relevant for . Normally, knowledge of agricultural machines is necessary to determine the relevance. Experience in the field of agricultural machines and general knowledge of the classification in ,  and  should be required in order to establish a proper classification.
