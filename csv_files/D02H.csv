"D02H","WARPING, BEAMING OR LEASING","","","","","","Warpingcomprises winding parts of the warp yarns, normally from bobbins, on a warping beam, whereby sequential parts are wound next to each other until the full weaving width is covered. The warping beam is then normally in a next step of warp preparation used for beamingBeamingcomprises winding the full width of the warp yarns in a single winding operation on the weaving beam (i.e. the beam which is to be placed on the loom). The warp yarns can be wound from a creel or a warping beam.Leasingcomprises inserting lease cords between the warp yarns to separate groups of warp yarns.Fibrea relatively-short, elongated member of natural or artificial materialFilament:an endless or quasi-endless, elongated member of natural (e.g. silk) or artificial materialYarna unitary assembly of fibres, usually produced by spinningThread:an assembly of yarns or filaments, usually produced by twisting","This place covers: Apparatuses and methods for warping, beaming and leasing of warp yarns in preparation of the weaving process."
