Hitches which are used not between vehicles e.g. Between bikes. No 5th-wheel couplings. Electrical / hydraulic / pneumatic connections as long as the hitch / part of the hitch is concerned, as e.g. Fixation to the hitch, sensor on the hitch, etc."

If a connection is solely claimed for connecting multiple bikes or motorbikes or connecting trailers solely to bikes or motorbikes then the connection should indeed not be classified in   but in the respective classes for bikes or motorbikes like e.g.  . For classifying such a document it should then be referred to that field only. However, in practise most of the connections are NOT explicitly claimed for bikes or motorbikes which then makes the documents relevant to be classified in  ."
