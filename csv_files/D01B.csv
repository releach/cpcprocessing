"D01B1/00","Mechanical separation of fibres from plant material, e.g. seeds, leaves, stalks","","","","","","Stalkthe main stem of a herbaceous plant.","This place covers: The process steps used in separating fibres from the seeds (mainly cotton) and stalks or leaves (mainly flax or hemp) of plant material."
"D01B1/04","Ginning","","","","","","Ginningthe process of separating cotton fibres from their seeds and other agricultural waste","This place covers: The initial separation of harvested fibres and seeds in so called ginning machines."
"D01B1/12","Rippling","","","","","","Ripplingthe process of removing the seeds from the flax stalks","This place covers: An early stage process of pulling the dry flax plants through coarse combs for removing the seeds from the stalks."
"D01B1/14","Breaking or scutching, e.g. of flax; Decorticating","","","","","","Scutchingthe process whereby the woody portion of the stalks is removed by crushing them between two metal rolls","This place covers: The mechanical separation of fibres from the wood of the stalks."
"D01B1/48","Drying retted fibres","","","","","","Rettinga process employing the action of bacteria and moisture on stalks (e.g. flax stalks) to dissolve or rot away much of the cellular tissues and gummy substances (i.e. pectin) surrounding bast-fibre bundles (i.e. fibre loosening). Basic methods include natural retting (i.e. dew retting or water retting) or chemical retting.","This place covers: Only the drying methods and apparatuses of fibres obtained from retting."
