"E05B","LOCKS; ACCESSORIES THEREFOR; HANDCUFFS","","","","","","Bolt means a sliding, pivoted, or otherwise movable member such as is normally carried by a door to hold it shut by engagement with a keeper on the frame. It may be operated by hand directly or through mechanism or by a key; it may be a latch (see below);Frame means any member to which a wing may be held by a fastening device. It does not include a framework forming part of the wing, but it may be another wing.Haspmeans a member hinged to the frame or wing so that it can be moved towards the face of the wing or frame and secured thereto, e.g. by a turn-button, by a padlock and staple.Latch means a bolt arranged to be moved to the releasing position against the force of a spring, or some other returning force, when a wing meets the frame on closing, so that it does not have to be operated by hand to secure the wing, but only to open it.Lockmeans primarily a device for releasing or securing any member, which requires a key or a permutation mechanism for release. In groups - , - , - , , ,  and  however, the term ""lock"" may include other fastening devices. Wingis a general term for swingable, slidable, or otherwise movable doors or windows. This term also includes other movable structures such as drawers, lids of chests, car boots, or car bonnets, to which the operating, mounting, latching, or locking means covered by this class may be applied.","This place covers: Locks for swingable, slidable, or otherwise movable wings, e.g. doors or windows, for restricting access, which are usually, but not necessarily always, unlocked by means of a key or equivalent means, e.g. combination means, electrical means, etc. It also covers handles or knobs for wings, including handles for wings which do not operate the locking mechanism. It additionally covers latching or locking means for other movable structures such as drawers, lids of chests, vehicle doors, vehicle lids for luggage or engine compartments, to which the locking means covered by this subclass may be applied. It further covers devices for locking clothing, locks specially adapted for bicycles, locks for locking portable objects against unauthorised removal and handcuffs."

One particular example is that a door handle could be accidentally actuated in case of a collision against the side door of a vehicle. One way of preventing such an unwanted actuation is the provision of an extra long bowden cable. The extra length thereby prevents unwanted actuation, if a vehicle part is deformed. The figure shows another construction, which should avoid actuation at the moment of a collision. Two parallel connecting rods (10, 11) are provided, such that if one of the rods (10,11) would be deformed during an accident, then it could not cause the lever (9) to turn since the second lever (11) would resist this by an equal force acting to turn the lever (9) in the opposite direction."

In practice, it almost always concerns engine compartment locks ( ) The example in the figure concerns an active front hood system, whereby both the hinge part (41) and the lock (25) are designed such that they are automatically raising the hood (13) in case of a collision with a pedestrian. This allows the front zone of the vehicle to deform easier."
"E05B77/10","Allowing opening in case of deformed bodywork, e.g. by preventing deformation of lock parts","","","","","","","This place covers: The general problem that a wing/door is frequently deformed at an accident. In this subgroup the lock is protected in such a way that it can be unlatched/unlocked even if the door is deformed. This is often achieved by protective plates, shields and reinforcements. Another alternative is to design lock parts in order to be deformed in a controlled way, such that they can still function after an accident. In the figure the bolt (8) and the detent (13) are provided with deformation zones (17, 25, 26). In case of an accident the bolt and the detent will not break. They will rather be deformed plastically such that they will still function properly after the collision."
"E05B77/12","Automatic locking or unlocking at the moment of collision","","","","","","","This place covers: Arrangements whereby a particular action is forced to take place in case of an accident. The situation is more or less the opposite of   in which a particular action is prevented. A typical example is that a locking or an unlocking action is initiated at the accident. The choice of action depends on the security philosophy. Sometimes an unlocked door, which allows easy escape, is preferred and sometimes the preference is a locked door, which prevents (unwanted) opening of the door. Another frequent example from this class is locks which after an accident remain locked for a certain time and then automatically move to an unlocked condition. The example of the figure shows a system whereby a sensing means (50) is designed to pivot in case of an accident. This releases the bolt element (26) which is moved by a spring (52) into a striker (56). The door is therefore automatically locked at the moment of an accident."

"E05B77/16","Preventing locking with the bolt in the unlatched position, i.e. when the door is open","","","","","","","This place covers: Locks in which the bolt position is sensed e.g. mechanically, magnetically or electrically. An unlatched bolt should thereby indicate an open door, and in this situation the locking system is blocked in order to make it possible to lock the door only after it has been closed. The example of the figure illustrates this by a detent (20) having a cam (46) and a locking lever (24) having a shoulder (48). When the bolt (14) is in its open position, the locking lever (24) cannot move to the locked position, since the shoulder (48) of the locking lever (24) is blocked by the cam (46) on the detent."
"E05B77/18","Keyless locking with self-cancellation, e.g. resulting in an unlocking action when the door is being closed","","","","","","","This place covers: Locks where the closing of the door always results in an unlocking action. The lock will thus never be in a locked state after having closed the door. This means that the door can always be unlatched after closing."
"E05B77/20","Override of self-cancellation, e.g. by actuation of the handle while the door is being closed","","","","","","","This place covers: Arrangements whereby the automatic unlocking action can be prevented by overriding means, which require an additional action by the user, e.g. that the door handle is actuated during the closing of the door. The user can thus decide, that the door should remain locked after closing, but this choice requires that a certain action is carried out during the closing. This makes it less likely, that the door is by mistake closed in a locked state. According to the exemplifying figures, a lever (60) is actuated by a handle and can be used for unlatching the lock, if a release lever (64) can hit a pin (42) on the detent. A locking lever (66) can move the release lever (64) to a locked position in which it will not hit the pin (42) as shown in the lower figure. A cam element (92a, 92b) rotates together with the actual latch bolt. If the lock is brought to the locked position when the door and thereby also the bolt are in the open position, then the closing of the door will rotate the bolt to the latched position. The cam (92b) will therefore act on an intermediate element (94), which brings the locking lever (66) back to the unlocked position. If however the handle lever (60) is actuated during the closing of the door, then the cam (92b) will not be able to contact the intermediate3 element (94) as shown in the right-hand figure. The lock will thereby stay in the locked position."

Child safety prevents the use of an inside handle at any time, i.e. the inside handle can never be used regardless if the door is unlocked or locked from the outside.

The double-locking can be achieved either by uncoupling or blocking of the inside lock system and inside handle. In the figure, an example of a blocking system is shown. A double-lock arrangement (9, 12) prevents any actuation of an inside lock knob rod (7)."
"E05B77/30","allowing opening by means of an inner door handle, even if the door is locked","","","","","","","This place covers: A combined unlocking and unlatching function of the inside door handle. This is sometimes achieved by one single actuation of the handle. Another possibility is that a first actuation of the handle unlocks the door and that the second actuation unlatches the door. The figure shows an example of an inside handle (7), which can be moved from a neutral position (A) to an unlatching position (B). If the door would be locked, then the same handle can be moved from the neutral position (A) to an intermediate position (C) and back to the neutral position (A) in order to unlock the lock.
