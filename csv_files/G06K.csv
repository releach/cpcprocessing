Recognising patterns means the labelling (categorisation, classification, identification) of a pattern, being measured data representing an object, with a meaningful label, based on the measured data from the object. It can also concern the detection of predetermined classes of patterns. The recognition function has tolerance to variability of objects within a class. The label is meaningful in the sense that it represents a group of objects which share common properties or features. The label can be one of multiple labels (e.g. OCR) or binary (e.g. authentication). Methods or systems for recognising patterns include the following functions: Acquisition of the pattern measurements. Acquisition includes stripping measured data not ""belonging"" to the pattern to be identified. (optional): pre-processing of the measurements, which should reduce the raw acquired / measured data. Determining / measuring features of the pattern (e.g. components in a spectral transformation) is a typical pre-processing for pattern recognition, but also size normalisation, etc can be involved.
