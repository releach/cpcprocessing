Different solid materials settle at different rates.FlocculationThis refers to a process where a solute comes out of solution in the form of floc or ""flakes"". The term is also used to refer to the process by which fine particulates are caused to clump together into floc. The floc may then float to the top of the liquid, settle to the bottom of the liquid, or can be readily filtered from the liquid. Sodium silicate is a common flocculating agent.Flotation(Also known as froth flotation) A separation process whereby water and chemicals are added to a mixture of solids to form a pulp while developing differences in surface tension between the various species in the solids mixture. The pulp is then copiously aerated and the preferred (aerophilic) species clings to bubbles and floats as a mineralized froth, which is then skimmed off.

This difference in surface properties yields in a different tendency of the particles to attach to air bubbles. The surface properties are often modified so as to achieve a desired behaviour of a material fraction. Froth flotation involves thus three phases (solids, water, gas) with complex interactions and subprocesses. In a typical flotation process water and chemicals are added to a mixture of solids to form a pulp. The pulp is then copiously aerated and the preferred (aerophilic) species clings to bubbles and floats as a mineralized froth, which is then skimmed off.CollectorSubstance for modifying the surface properties of a specified material (e.g the ore) so as to enhance floatability. It involves hydrophobising the particle surface by adsorption of molecules or ions.FrotherSubstance for stabilising the bubbles when reaching the surface of the pulp by forming a layer of reasonably stable froth, thus preventing remixing of the floated fraction.DepressantSubstance for modifying the surface properties of a specified material (e.g the gangue) so as to reduce floatability.DispersantSubstance for preventing unwanted aggregation of the solid fractions, e.g. for enhancing the selectivity of the flotation process.Coagulants and FlocculantsSubstance for increasing the particle size such as to induce flocculation, coagulation or agglomeration, e.g. for flotation processes for water purification or for fine particle processing.Modifying reagentsSubstances (other than depressants, dispersants, coagulants and flocculants) for controlling the physico-chemical state of the flotation process e.g. the pH, conductivity etc. or altering the effect of the other chemicals i.e. the collector or the frother.","This place covers: Flotation type separation apparatus or methods that include one or more of the following: Flotation agents according to the chemical constituents Froth-flotation processes, i.e., carrier flotation, flotation processes adapted for the flotation of fines, control of flotation processes; Agent recovery; Flotation machines, including pneumatic machines, machines with impellers, electroflotation machines, flotation machines using centrifugal forces, reactor-separator types and dissolved air flotation machines; Subsequent treatment of the froth, the feed and the tailings; Feed and discharge mechanisms for the material flow streams involved (feed, froth, sediments, reagents, pulp), Structural elements such as baffles and plates inside the flotation tank and"

When introducing a mixture of particles into a medium, e.g. a liquid, the fraction of particles showing a high sedimentation velocity will settle in a first, bottom layer whilst the fractions of particles showing a low sedimentation velocity will settle on top of that first layer.The liquid in differential sedimentation is used as a separation aid. The objective of this process is thus particle classification as opposed to the process of separating liquid from particles by sedimentation.The driving force for sedimentation is usually gravity or centrifugal force.Differential centrifugal sedimentation","This place covers: Differential sedimentation is used for separating a mixture of particulate material into its fractions (for a definition of differential sedimentation, refer to the glossary of terms).
