The invention per se should be classified in the last appropriate class(es). Ideally, one class should be given for covering the main aspect of the invention per se. Exceptionally, the core of the invention may also be classified by using up to three classes.","","Pulpa dispersion e.g. an aqueous suspension comprising paper-making fibres and optional additives, which is to be processed, and covers the term ""stock""; it also means dry paper-making fibres which are to be made into paper by either wet or dry processes.Paperpaper, cardboard or wet-laid non-woven. Note also that there is e.g. a class for multi-ply paper comprising dry-laid paper () and that the paper e.g. can consist of 100% non-cellulosic fibres ( ). Binder or binding agentusually a macromolecular product used to bind the paper-making fibres together in order to give cohesion to the final paper sheet [e.g. starchy materials, latexes, etc.].Fibresunder paper-making fibres are meant short fibres (maximum length in the range of the mm). Papers also comprising long fibres or filaments are classified in .Filler or pigmentusually designating fine particles added to the pulp (very often inorganic materials such as talc, kaolin, silica, calcium carbonate, etc.).Sizing agent or hydrophobizing agentagent added in order to increase the hydrophobicity of the paperCoatinglayer of material applied to the paper substrate. Although part of this material may penetrate through the substrate, a coated paper is characterized by the presence of said layer on its surface.Impregnationapplication of a liquid material to a paper substrate wherein the liquid material penetrates substantially the substrate [e.g. by submerging the substrate into a bath containing the liquid material].","This place covers: Pulp compositions for paper manufacturing, papers obtained therefrom, coated papers and impregnated paper. It also covers the processes for adding materials to pulp or papers and after-treatments of papers as well as special papers."
