In this context, devices for specific applications are normally (unless some agreements are provided between technical fields) to be classified in these more specific application fields, especially where these fields foresee classes for devices (for example devices for combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, manufacturing of semi-conductors etc.) and not in -. Consequently processes or apparatus for specific applications should be at a first stage classified in the relevant specific classes for these processes or apparatus.

General concepts, e.g. as presented in review articles, relating to catalyst systems and methods of making them, the concept being defined by a common material or method/theory are indexed in   -  . Indexing codes   -   specify the presence and type of polynuclearity, as well as linkage type of the metals involved among themselves. Indexing codes   -   characterise the complexes on the basis of bond-type (linkage-type) between central metal(s), thereby specifying the structural geometry of the complexes, while classification entries   -   are purely compositional subdivisions. Indexing codes   -   broadly characterise ligands by their function. Indexing codes   -   are used to index the individual (central) metals in the (polynuclear) complexes.

The respective lower groups define these heteroatom groups further. A further primary subdivision is according to generic statements of function of substituent groups on the ligand, cf.  .
