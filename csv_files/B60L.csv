Braking is accomplished by reversing the electric fields on the machine, effectively turning it into a generator. The usage of the generated power, either in useful applications or as dissipation of heat, restrains the motor-generator and provides a braking action.As such, this term is virtually coterminous with ""dynamo-electric braking system"" (see below). However the term ""electrodynamic"" on its own is broader and less clear than the term ""dynamo-electric"". It means ""pertaining to electric current, electricity in motion and the effects of magnetism and induction"", and could theoretically encompass electrical devices other than dynamo-electric devices. batterygeneric term covering primary and secondary electrical cells.dynamo-electric braking systemA dynamo-electric machine is a device for converting electrical energy into mechanical energy or mechanical energy into electrical energy or combinations thereof, which involve electromagnetic induction. In respect of brakes, a braking effect could be produced by converting the kinetic energy of a vehicle into electrical energy, for dissipation (e.g. by resistors or as eddy-currents) or for storage (e.g. by regenerative braking). Alternatively, electrical energy could be supplied to the device to drive it into reverse, thereby producing a braking effect.electric vehicleVehicle propelled by electric motor(s), these motors being mechanically connected to the drive wheels. This definition embraces also vehicles with engine-driven generators, sometimes referred to a as serial hybrid vehicles.hybrid vehicleVehicles having two or more prime movers of more than one type connected with the driven wheels, e.g. electrical and internal combustion motors, and that are either singularly or in combination used for propulsion of the vehicle.plug-in hybrid vehicleHybrid vehicle which uses rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug or other connection means to an external electric power source.primary cellelectrochemical generator in which the cell energy is present in chemical form and is not regenerated.range extenderDevices to extend the range of an electric vehicles supplied by a traction battery. Most of the time the term refers to an engine driven generator. It can however also refer to fuel cells or additional energy storage for electrical energy. Range extenders have generally a lower power than the maximum output of the vehicle.prime moverA machine that transforms energy from thermal, electrical or pressure form to mechanical form, typically an engine or turbinesecondary cellaccumulator receiving and supplying electrical energy by means of reversible electrochemical reactions.fuel cellelectrochemical generator wherein the reactants are supplied from outside.","This place covers: Supply of electric power to auxiliary equipment of electrically-propelled vehicles, e.g. electric heating or lighting circuits.
