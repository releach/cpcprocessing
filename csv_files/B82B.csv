The essential integral elements of nanostructural assemblages when they include structural features limiting their use to these assemblages. The manufacture or treatment of the above type of nanostructural assemblages when the manufacturing or treating creates an essential structural feature of an assemblage and utilizes either: Processes having one or more steps with specialized features directly related to individually manipulating atoms or molecules as discrete units when forming final products, or Apparatus specially adapted for performing at least one step in such processes."
