This latter matrix is produced by applying fluid plaster or said multilayer tissue paper by using contact pressure onto the surface of a type bed being filled with a prearranged set of printing types carrying alphanumerical or decorative symbols representing e.g. a full page to be printed, fixed together in an open frame.Stereotype printing surfacesletterpress or relief type printing devices used in flat type bed printing presses and in rotary letterpress machines.","This place covers: Making of stereotype printing surfaces, means for casting stereotype plates including machines, moulds and accessories, processes for handling and treating stereotype plates, and processes for preparing stereotype matrices. Means and processes for shaping into relief form elastic or deformable material like rubber or plastics. The raised parts having an almost flat top surface define the image to be printed, e.g. alphanumerical or decorative symbols, in relief or letterpress type printing apparatus."
