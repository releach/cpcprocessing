Sorting of articles in so far as the same conditions apply, e.g. sorting of timber by passing it over successively longer openings; the articles may or may not be orientated for the purpose of sorting. Sieving, screening, sifting or sorting solid materials using networks, gratings, grids or the like. Separating solids from solids that are initially a mixture using apparatus or methods that subject the mixture to a gas current, dispenses the mixture within a gas, carries the mixture on a gas current while it is being separated, or uses a gas current on it to cause separation, including combinations of disparate types of apparatus utilizing gas currents in the separation of solids from solids. Other types of apparatus for directly controlled dry method grading or sorting of solid materials in a bulk form or of loose articles that are being handled like solid type bulk material, e.g. grading according to size or weight or using momentum effects. Constructional features of screens per se, or screens and their driving mechanisms, which are used in dry or wet separating methods. Combinations of disparate types of apparatus or methods for separating solids from solids that applicable to bulk material or to loose articles fit to be handled like bulk material. Accessories that are specially adapted for, or arranged in conjunction with, the above types of separating, sorting or grading of bulk material or articles."
