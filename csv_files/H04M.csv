However, many recent documents relate to xDSL equipments (modems and concentrators). The xDSL family allows high speed access to the Internet and multimedia services over the local loop. The local loop is formed of an unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and connects the subscriber xDSL modem at customer premises to subscriber line concentrator like a DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer) at the central office for connection to a broadband network. Splitters, comprising filters for each frequency band, are necessary so that the subscriber telephone and the data equipments do not interfere. The data bands definition, and the techniques for combining the data signals in the data bands depend on the type of xDSL: ADSL (Asymmetric DSL), SDSL (Symmetric DSL), HDSL (High speed DSL), VDSL (Very high speed DSL), MDSL (Multirate DSL), RADSL (Low Rate Adaptive DSL). As an example, the frequency bands of ADSL are as follows. The voice part of the spectrum (the lowest 4 kHz) is separated from the rest by a passive filter, called a POTS splitter. ADSL makes use of advanced modulation techniques, such as discrete multitone (DMT) technology. DMT divides the bandwidth from about 10 kHz into a set of 265 independent subchannels, each 4 kHz wide. By measuring the quality of the subchannels and then assigning a bit-rate to each based on its quality, DMT customizes the transmit signal for every line. In doing so, it automatically avoids regions of the frequency spectrum that are too noisy or too attenuated to support reliable communications. If the quality of a subchannel degrades enough to affect a system's error performance, the data rate on that subchannel is lowered and the excess traffic moves to a subchannel capable of supporting it. The result is robust communications over single twisted pairs. As its name implies, ADSL transmits data asymmetrically at different rates upstream toward the central office and downstream toward the subscriber."

In a first aspect, this subsubgroup relates to techniques that take advantage of the fact that speech is mostly composed of silences. During these silences, data can be sent without the subscriber noticing it, provided that it is replaced at the receiving telephone by blanks. In order to receive and remove the data, the start and the end of the data segments is signalled from one end to the other. In a second aspect, this subgroup also concerns techniques for interrupting a data communication which was happening when no any voice communication was going on the telephone line. The objective of such systems is to avoid that the subscriber can not use his telephone for voice communication when for instance his modem is transmitting data."
