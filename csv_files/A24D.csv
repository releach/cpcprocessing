"A24D","CIGARS; CIGARETTES; TOBACCO SMOKE FILTERS; MOUTHPIECES FOR CIGARS OR CIGARETTES; MANUFACTURE OF TOBACCO SMOKE FILTERS OR MOUTHPIECES","","","","","","Cigarette""cigarette"" means: (1) a small tube of wrapper containing tobacco or tobacco substitutes which people smoke by igniting it directly and where the tobacco (or the tobacco substitute) is burned; (2) in a broader sense it also means a small tube of wrapper containing tobacco or tobacco substitutes which is associated with a heat source at manufacturing or inserted by the user in a device containing a heat source, and where the tobacco (or the tobacco substitute) is heated without being burned. In this broader sense, the word ""rod"" is also often used in place of cigarette.Simulated smoking device""simulated smoking devices"" means devices simulating the act of smoking without burning tobacco, e.g. so called electronic cigarettes","This place covers: Cigars, Cigarettes Tobacco smoke filters Manufacture of tobacco smoke filters or mouthpieces"
