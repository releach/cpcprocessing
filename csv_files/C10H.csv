The calcium carbonate is first converted into calcium oxide and the coal into coke, then the two are reacted together to form calcium carbide and carbon monoxide:CaO + 3C → CaC2 + COCalcium carbide (calcium acetylide) and water are then reacted by any of several methods to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide, by a reaction discovered by Friedrich Wöhler in 1862.CaC2 + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2 + C2H2","This place covers: Methods and apparatus for production of acetylene by wet methods, including arrangements for water feed and carbide feed; high-pressure acetylene generators; details of acetylene generators, e.g. carbide cartridges, carbide compositions, safety devices, sludge removal."
