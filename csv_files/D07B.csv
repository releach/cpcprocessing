The linked Indexing Code  indicates that the specific material is used as coating. Further details can be found in the indexing scheme relating to ropes or cables in general.Examples:The invention is directed to a rope wherein a liquid lubricant is used to reduce the internal wear. In order to avoid that the liquid disappears during use, the rope is covered with a jacket. This is claimed in the independent claim. The description and dependent claims further mention that the rope comprises a wire for conducting electricity without defining special constructions. Aramid filaments are preferred as the load bearing entity. HMPE can also be used. The embodiments relate to braided ropes used for fishing nets.
