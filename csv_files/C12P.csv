The appropriate product group(s) should always be given in addition. Since the production of methane (biogas) by bacterial consortia is long known, it is deemed unnecessary to generally classify biogas processes in , unless if the use of a specific consortium or the addition of certain species of microorganisms is indicated in the method.","C12P39/00","","This place covers: Processes wherein two or more species of microorganisms of different genera are used together to produce a product. The microorganisms may be in direct contact with each other like in a consortium. Alternatively, the microorganisms may also be separated by a physical barrier (e.g. a permeable membrane), but still are indirectly in contact via a medium (e.g. aqueous buffer). Such processes may involve the co-transformation of a substrate, or a stepwise transformation wherein a first microorganism produces an intermediate that is transformed by a second microorganism. Alternatively, the microorganisms are not each involved in product formation but act together as a consortium, e.g. as symbionts, wherein one type of microorganism supports growth of another."

The appropriate product group(s) should always be given in addition.","","","This place covers: Methods to obtain an optical isomer (=enantiomer) of a compound from the racemic mixture of that compound or of a precursor substrate that is not optically active, using an enzyme or a microorganism. Such methods may comprise: Enantioselective derivatisation of one of the two enantiomers of a racemic substrate, the product(s) of interest being either the unreacted enantiomer of the substrate or the newly formed enantiomeric product, or both. The reaction may take place at the stereogenic centre or at a group different therefrom. Stereoselective derivatisation of a prochiral compound, e.g. enantioselective reduction of a prochiral ketone Metabolization of one of the enantiomers of a racemic compound"
