One has, in any case, to bear in mind that in the recent decades, a distinction between an electronic and an electromechanical timepiece has become more and more pointless, in some case even useless. For this reason,   is nowadays used to classify electromechanical aspects of clocks or watches in general, without putting an excessive stress on the nature of the timepiece as a whole (for more info, see ""Overlapping with external fields"" below)."
