A foam (p)article can be porous cellular, expanded, foamed, pre- or post-foamed, pre- or post-expanded.A foam contains pores, cavities or cells, which can be closed, open or interconnected.A foam is porous, macroporous, microporous (1-100 microns diameter) or nanoporous (1-100 nanometers).The pores distribution can be for unimodal, bimodal or trimodal.Porous polymeric aerogels, organogels or xerogels can be regarded as foams.","B29C|C08J9/00|C08J9/0038|C08J9/02|C08J9/149|C08J9/16|C08J9/35|C08J9/0019|C08J9/0038|C08J9/0014|C08J|C08J9/127|C08L|C08J2300/00|C08J2399/00|C08J2300/00|C08L|C08J2325/06|C08L25/06|C08J2300/00|C08J2300/30|C08J2300/00|C08J9/141|C08J2325/06|C08J9/141|C08J2325/06|C08J2323/06|C08J2300/00|C08J2399/00|C08J2400/00|C08J2499/00|C08J9/0061|C08J2325/06|C08J2433/12|C08J9/0061|C08J2425/06|C08J2323/06|C08J2423/06|C08J2325/06|C08J2300/00|C08J2399/00|C08J2400/00|C08J2499/00|C08J9/0061|C08J2400/00|C08J2499/00|C08J9/0061|C08J2425/06|C08J9/224|C08J2400/00|C08J2499/00|C08J2300/00|C08J2399/00|C08J9/33|C08J2400/00|C08J2499/00|C08J9/35|C08J9/33|C08J2300/00|C08J2399/00|C08J9/26|C08J2201/04|C08J2201/0484|C08J9/26|C08J9/28|C08J2201/05|C08J2201/0545|C08J9/28"," Blowing agentSubstance which is either gaseous at ambient temperature or capable of reversibly becoming gaseous upon heating ( or subgroups).
