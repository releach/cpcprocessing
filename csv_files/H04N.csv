A/D converters can be of any type and can be specifically designed for photoelectric pixel circuits and/or to work in combination with other pixel elements like transfer gates, reset gates, source followers, etc. A/D converters can be used to convert the image signal from the pixel to a digital value. A/D converters can be used to generate a digital value for controlling different characteristics of the pixel like its exposure time or sensitivity. Some pixels circuits comprising converters provide an analogue and a digital output or a multiplexed digital and analogue output. The converters convert current or voltage levels to signals with different frequency – current to frequency (I/F) converter or use voltage controlled oscillator to perform voltage to frequency conversion (V/F). The converters convert the signal from the photo sensor to a time-dependent signal (V/T or I/T converter). These circuits are sometimes called ADC using pulse width modulation (PWM). A comparator measures the duration of the exposure time needed for the pixel to reach a predetermined threshold. The duration of the pulse corresponds to the pixel level. The duration of the pulse can be converted to a digital value by using a counter or to analogue signal using a ramp signal. The converters are ADC converters that count the number of exposure periods. These circuits are sometimes also called voltage to frequency converters or ADC using pulse frequency modulation (PFM). The duration of each exposure period is defined by a control circuit that determines when the signal from the photodiode reaches a predetermined threshold. The control circuit normally performs a reset operation and starts the new exposure period. Note that a part of or the entire control circuit can be implemented outside the pixel array.

A display device not requiring glasses to provide a stereoscopic effect to the viewer. An autostereoscopic display uses a parallax generating optic which projects or displays different images to the viewer, thus creating a sense of depth. The parallax-generating optic may include, for example, parallax barriers; lenticular lenses; an array of controllable light sources or a moving aperture or light source; - fly-eye lenses; dual and multilayer devices that are driven by algorithms to implement compressive light field displays; such devices are also called Content-Adaptive Parallax Barriers; varifocal lenses or mirrors. It is noted that volumetric displays are classified in  and holographic displays are classified in , whereas autostereoscopic display are classified in .Multi-viewProviding more than two different views to one or more viewers according to their viewing position or direction; the views can be 2D or 3D Automultiscopic displays This is a shorter synonym for the expression ""multi-view autostereoscopic 3D display""Volumetric displaysA device generating a ""solid"" image, i.e. not an image on the surface of a display, but one having a real depth, for example by projecting 2D image slices at different planes within a viewing volume. Such systems have been considered to fall within the definition of stereoscopic systems because the viewer's eyes perceive two different pictures.Lenticular lensesAn array of thin cylindrical lenslets (normally less than 1mm wide) placed vertically in front of, or behind a display or light modulator in order to generate optically directive views in autostereoscopic displays or cameras.Parallax barriersAn array of opaque strips and thin slits arranged to occlude portions of a displayed image in left and right viewing regions. The slits are spatially arranged to ensure that the left/right image portions are only visible in the corresponding left/right viewing regions for which they are intended. The parallax barrier may be provided by a static physical layer in which the slits are precisely positioned, or electronically generated on an adaptive intermediate LCD layer. The parallax barrier may also be adjacent to camera circuitry for image collection.Fly-eye lensesAn array of very small bidimensional lenses (typically circular / hemispherical) placed in front of a display, light modulator or image sensor like a normal lenticular lens, providing bidimensional parallax.Pseudo-stereoscopicRelating to stereoscopic or 3D visual effects obtained without sending different views to the viewer's eyes. The same term is sometimes used to denote the effect whereby the left and right images are seen by the wrong eyes, due to viewing from an unsuitable position in front of an auto-stereoscopic display.Integral imagingA technique of image capture or display which uses a fly's eye or a lenticular lens in front of the image sensor/display in order to capture/display images with parallax.Plenoptic camerasA camera, normally non-stereoscopic, using a technique allowing focusing after image capture, by means of a lenticular lens array combined with a plurality of (small) image sensors. A plenoptic camera is also known as a light-field camera.","This place covers: Systems that generate stereoscopic or multi-view signals from cameras, or provide stereoscopic or multi-view signals to displays. It also covers electronic signal processing aspects of such systems. Examples: Stereoscopic and multi-view electronic image pick up devices (video cameras, digital still cameras) Stereoscopic and multi-view display devices Electronic signal processors: for stereoscopic signal processing; monoscopic to stereoscopic conversion; for stereoscopic image generation (including from a computer model); for stereoscopic displays (e.g. for left/right synchronisation, stereoscopic format conversion or depth adaptation); for displays providing different 2D images to different viewers (e.g. for use in vehicles); for devices that generate a two-dimensional ""look around"" effect, e.g. non-stereoscopic multi-view systems (see however exclusions here below) Devices generating a real 3D image, i.e. an image having a volume (volumetric displays) Pseudo-stereoscopic systems Systems in which the viewer's eyes do not see different images, but which may provide a pseudo-stereoscopic effect, are classified in  . The effect must go beyond that provided by the mere display of a 3D object on a 2D screen (like in a CAD system). Example: Wiggle stereoscopy: pseudo-stereo systems providing a three dimensional effect by means of normal 2D image signals, by periodic oscillating motion of a 3D object. Multi-view systems: systems providing different 2D or 3D views of the same scene to one or more viewers according to the viewpoint location (called ""look around"" effect); systems providing different 2D or 3D views of different scenes to different viewers (called ""privacy"" systems) These systems are classified in   if they provide said views simultaneously or at least at a sufficiently high frame rate so as to be simultaneously viewed by the viewers. However, multi-view systems wherein said 2D views are provided to a viewer one at a time, e.g. by user selection, are not classified in  , because they are actually normal 2D systems although the viewpoint can be selected at will. Examples of multi-view devices falling under  : ""look-around"" display systems including displays in which a lenticular lens provides different views of a common scene from different viewing positions ""privacy"" display systems including displays in which a parallax barrier provides different views of different scenes to different viewers in 2D or 3D (for example in a vehicle, wherein on a common screen the driver is watching GPS while the passenger is watching a movie) Multi-user displays displaying different pictures for different viewers wearing shutter glasses to select one of said pictures (this is also ""privacy""), wherein said pictures are 2D or 3D pictures."
