"B60K6/42","characterised by the architecture of the hybrid electric vehicle","","","","","","Series type or Range extenderHEVs having at least two motor-generators in which the first motor-generator is mechanically connected for driving or braking the wheels supplied by a battery which power is mostly generated by the second motor-generator mechanically connected to the combustion engine. Example: The combustion engine is mechanically connected to a motor-generator. The combustion engine is not mechanically connected to the wheels. All the output energy of the combustion engine is converted to electrical energy. The energy is used to drive a second electric machine connected to the wheels and/or to charge the energy storing means. The second electric machine will be used as generator during braking. (US5214358, example also classified in  for mechanical accumulators ) Parallel type HEVs having a single motor-generator in which both the combustion engine and the motor-generator can directly drive the wheels. Parallel type HEVs in which the motor-generator only assist the combustion engine and cannot drive the wheels alone are specially defined as 'motor assist type'. Therefore 'parallel type' is assigned to HEVs in which the motor generator can drive the wheels alone without the engine being connected to the wheels. Example: There is a single motor-generator and the combustion engine is mechanically connected to the motor-generator, via a clutch or via differential gearing. The motor-generator is also mechanically connected to the wheels. The vehicle is driven electrically by the motor-generator or mechanically by the engine or by both in combination. (EP941883) Motor-assist type Parallel type HEV in which the motor-generator only assist the combustion engine and cannot drive the wheels alone. Example: The motor-generator is mechanically connected to the engine. There is no clutch or differential gearing between motor-generator and engine. The combustion engine is mechanically connected to the wheels. (FR2480042) Series-parallel typeHEV having at least two motor-generators, which include the functions of both the series type and the parallel type. Series-parallel switching type Series-parallel type HEV in which the mode can be switched between series mode and parallel mode. Example: The combustion engine is directly connected to a first motor-generator. There is a second motor-generator mechanically connected to the wheels and a clutch between the two motor-generators. In the series mode the clutch will be disengaged and the second motor generator will drive the wheels by using the electric power generated by the first motor generator. In the parallel mode the clutch will be engaged and the engine directly drives the wheels with or without assistance by the motor generators. (US5513719) Differential gearing distribution type Series-parallel type HEVs in which the combustion engine power is distributed or summed by a differential, e.g. a planetary gearing, to the first motor-generator and the wheels, and the electric power generated by the first motor-generator is used to drive the second motor-generator mechanically connected to either the wheels or the combustion engine. The series-mode energy flow path is established when the second motor-generator is driven by the electric power generated by the first motor-generator, while the parallel-mode energy flow path is established when the wheels are driven by both the combustion engine and the second motor-generator. Motor-generator currents are controlled to determine the energy flow path through the drive units.Example: The combustion engine is mechanically connected to a motor-generator via a first element of a differential gearing. A second motor-generator is connected to a second element of the differential gearing. The differential gearing also connects one or both of the motor-generators to the wheels. (US20010049570, example also classified in  ) Electrical distribution type Series-parallel type HEVs in which the engine power is distributed, using a first motor-generator which is specific as a double rotor-type motor-generator, into mechanical power for driving the wheels and electric power for driving a second motor-generator connected to either the wheels or the combustion engine. The series-mode energy flow path is established when the second motor-generator is driven by the electric power generated by the first motor-generator, while the parallel-mode energy flow path is established when the wheels are driven by both the combustion engine and the second motor-generator. Motor-generator currents are controlled to determine the energy flow path through the drive units. Example: The combustion engine shaft is mechanically connected to the inner rotor of a double-rotor type motor-generator. The outer rotor of the double-rotor type is connected to the second motor generator which is connected to the shaft driving the wheels. (US5988307)",""
