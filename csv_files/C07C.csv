For instance  covers ester of benzoic acid, but not esters of chlorobenzoic acid ().On the other hand, when a compound is mentioned in the group title only as an example, such as in  ""the condensed ring system being a [4.4.0] system, e.g. naphthols""), the scope is not limited to this example.Compounds claimed per se:Which compounds are classified?Real examples of claimed compounds, i.e. those which are prepared or for which physical data are given, andcompounds which are individually named or drawn in the claims.Which compounds are generally not classified?Long lists (""shopping lists"") of prophetic compounds which fall within the scope of the claims but which have not actually been prepared and characterised or at least individually claimed.Compounds disclosed in the description but which are not claimed as novel compounds (e.g. prior art compounds).Markush enumeration of generic formulae to generate individual compounds, i.e. no attempt is made to classify all possible individual compounds falling within the scope of a Markush formula.Compounds defined in terms of a process of preparation (product-by-process definition), e.g. ""A compound prepared by the process of claim 1"", are classified only if the compounds per se is claimed as novel.How are compounds classified?All examples are classified individually. Even if classification of the ""fully identified"" compounds would lead to the assigning of a large number of subgroups, no generalisation to the next hierarchically higher level is made.Compounds having a covalent bond to a solid support are classified as the corresponding compound wherein the solid support has been replaced by a hydrogen atom. In addition an Indexing Code (Indexing Code)  (""Compounds covalently bound to a solid support"") is assigned.Protected compounds are classified according to their individual structure (note: a tetrahydropyranyl (THP) protected compound would be classified in , a silyl protected compound in ).Deuterated and other isotopically labelled (e.g. radiolabelled) compounds, regardless whether the non-labelled equivalents are already known or not, are classified as compounds in the same class as the corresponding non-labelled compounds. In addition the Indexing Code  is assigned and the document proposed for classification in ).Polymorphic forms of known compounds are classified in the appropriate product class in same way as new compounds. In addition the Indexing Code  is assigned.Processes for the preparation of (known) compounds:Preparation also covers purification, separation, stabilisation or use of additives.Which processes are classified?Preparative examples of claimed processes, andProcesses for the preparation of products which are individually named or drawn in the claims.In exceptional cases, when there are no preparative examples and the claims do not define any specific products (e.g. for industrial processes), the detailed embodiments in the description (often explained with reference to the figures) are classified. Occasionally, the product has to be deduced from the educt and the reaction.Which processes are generally not classified?The preparation of long lists (""shopping lists"") of hypothetical products mentioned in the description which have not actually been made or at least individually claimed.Processes disclosed in the description which are not claimed as novel processes (e.g. prior art processes).The preparation of novel compounds is generally not classified. However, if the preparation appears to be of particular interest, the examiner may decide to classify such processes on a case by case basis. The rationale is to avoid filling the process groups with repeated standard methods used for making new compounds.How is a process classified?All examples are classified individuallyA process is classified in a process group if a dedicated process group exists. Where there is no process group for making a particular compound (e.g. for ester of oxyacids of halogen ) a process is classified in the product group.When a process is classified in a process group, combination sets are used to indicate the product of the process. A combination set consists of a process group, followed by and linked to the group of the product. The products are selected from the corresponding product groups (which means that product groups as such (not in form of a combination set) are only used for classifying compounds which are claimed as novel).For example the combination set ,  is used for the preparation of acrylic acid esters by esterification.For multi-step processes (these can be industrial processes comprising multiple reaction and/or purification steps and multi-step syntheses of fine chemicals in a sequence of reaction steps) the following rules apply :The last reaction step is always classified.If the last step is purification/separation/recovery step, it is additionally classified if of interest (e.g. not a mere standard purification/recovery step such as ""step f) of recovering the product"").All intermediate steps are generally also classified (especially those which are important for the invention) unless considered trivial and not useful for future searches.A process for the preparation of a specific crystallographic form of a compound (polymorph) is generally classified as separation/purification by crystallisation. In addition the indexing term  is assigned.Indexing of ring structures:If a classified compound or the product of a classified processes contains a carbocyclic ring system other than phenyl and naphthyl, an Indexing Code for the ring structure (main groups  - ) is assigned (e.g.  if a claimed or prepared compound contains a cyclohexyl ring). The following rules apply:All the possible ring systems are to be indexed; this implies that if a compound comprises more than one ring system, each system is indexed.Indexing Codes are assigned even if they provide no additional information about the ring system over the definition of the group in which the document is classified, e.g.  is used, if the document is classified in .The more general groups are only to be used for ring systems not specifically provided for.For each ring or ring system, the last place rule applies. However, in determining the rings defining the indexation the following criteria have to be taken into account:The number of rings in a condensed ring system equals the number of scissions necessary to convert the ring system into an acyclic chain.The rings with the lowest possible number of ring members and the condensed systems with the lowest number of shared atoms are to be chosen.Polycyclic compounds in which two rings have two, and only two, atoms in common are ""ortho-condensed"". Polycyclic compounds in which one ring contains two, and only two, atoms in common with each of two or more rings of a contiguous series of rings are ""ortho- and peri-condensed"".Rings are spiro condensed if they contain two rings with only one common atom. The spiro system is free when there is only one union, direct or indirect, between the rings. Otherwise the spiro system is ""not free"".Indexing of certain compound properties:Certain properties (such as optical activity or presence of isotopes) of classified compounds or products of a classified processes are indexed using Indexing Codes (main group ), e.g. if the claimed or prepared compound is an optical isomer, if the claimed or prepared compound is a crystalline form, e. g. a polymorphic form, which is characterised by the usual parameters, such a X-ray diffraction pattern, IR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The Indexing Code  is not used when polymorphic forms of compounds are merely claimed without being actually prepared. The code should also not be used for standard crystallisation processes (e.g. for purification) leading to the usual crystalline forms of compounds.","C07C1/00|C07C71/00|C07C401/00|C07C409/00|C07C69/712|C07C201/00|C07C395/00|C07C215/16|C07C215/68|C07C215/68|C07C233/05|C07C235/74|C07C235/74|C07C211/46|C07C55/08|C07C35/12|C07C69/78|C07C69/76|C07C35/36|C07B2200/11|C07D|C07F|C07B2200/05|C07B59/00|C07B2200/13|C07C71/00|C07C67/08|C07C69/54|C07B2200/13|C07C2601/00|C07C2604/00|C07C2601/14|C07C2601/14|C07C13/18|C07B2200/00|C07B2200/07|C07B2200/13|C07B2200/13","Acyclic Not containing any rings CarbocyclicContaining a ring or ring system where all ring members are carbon atomsMineral acidInorganic acids such as HF, HCl, HBr, HI, HNO, HSO, HSO, HPO, B(OH) and HCOEster of a mineral acidEster of the above acids, including organic carbonates (e.g. ethylene carbonate) and R-Hal (e.g. CH-Cl as ester of CH-OH and HCl)Non-metalsH, B, C, Si, N, P, O, S, Se, Te, noble gases, halogensMetalsElements other than non-metalsPlatinum groupOs, Ir, Pt, Ru, Rh, PdIron groupFe, Co, NiBridged (rings)Presence of at least one fusion other than ortho, peri or spiro, i.e. ring having more than two carbon atoms in commonCondensed ring systemTwo rings are ""condensed"" if they share at least one ring member, i.e. ""spiro"" and ""bridged"" are considered as condensed.""Number of rings"" in a condensed ring systemNumber of scissions necessary to convert the ring system into one acyclic chainOrganic compoundA compound satisfying one of the following criteria:- at least two carbon atoms bonded to each other, or- one carbon atom bonded to at least one hydrogen atom or halogen atom, or- one carbon atom bonded to at least one nitrogen atom by a single or double bond.Exceptions to the above criteria are: compounds consisting of only carbon atoms (e.g., fullerenes, etc.), cyanogen, cyanogen halides, cyanamide, metal carbides, phosgene, thiophosgene, hydrocyanic acid, isocyanic acid, isothiocyanic acid, fulminic acid, unsubstituted carbamic acid, and salts of the previously mentioned acids; these exceptions are considered to be inorganic compounds for classification purposesPolycyclicContaining two or more rings, condensed or isolated, e.g. a naphthyl ring or two isolated phenyl ringsPreparationCovers synthesis, purification, separation, stabilisation or use of additives, unless a separate place is provided in the classification schemeQuinonesOnly compounds which can be considered oxidation products of aromatic compounds (hydroquinones) are encompassed (acenaphthenequinone  or camphorquinone  are not considered as quinones)","This place covers: Acyclic or carbocyclic (alicyclic) low molecular weight organic compounds Processes for the preparation of acyclic or carbocyclic (alicyclic) low molecular weight organic compounds, whereby preparation also includes purification, separation, stabilisation or use of additives The subclass   is divided into the following fields* (each field covering both compounds and processes): Hydrocarbons (compounds containing exclusively carbon and hydrogen atoms)  -  Halogenated hydrocarbons (compounds containing exclusively carbon, hydrogen and halogen atoms)  -  Oxygen-containing compounds (may additionally contain halogen atoms)  -  Nitrogen-containing compounds (may additionally contain halogen and/or oxygen atoms)  -   Sulfur, Selenium and Tellurium-containing compounds (may additionally contain halogen, oxygen and/or nitrogen atoms)   -  Special compounds  -  *) In the absence of an indication to the contrary, a product or process is classified in the last appropriate place (last place rule)"
