For details, see belowCombination set (C-sets)1. Introduction1.1 This manual relates to the rules to be applied when classifying documents using C-sets in the ""cement part"" of subclass . With the ""cement part"" we mean the whole of the subclass, with the exception of the range  - .However, symbols of the range  -  can be used as Indexing Codes (when the classification is in  or ).1.2 C-sets are used in three major areas:-  -  and : Compositions of cement/concrete mixtures or of artificial stone like materials- : porous materials- : after treatment.1.3 Symbols that are used in the present C-set system are chosen from:-  -  (with the exception of ):these are symbols which can be used as classification as well as symbols in the combination sets (C-set), - , :these are symbols used as additional information (CCA) or within the C-set (see below).1.4 The principles of Combination sets are based on the possibilities offered by the IPC (until IPC7) for using classification symbols also as (linked) Indexing Codes.The C-sets are present in EPODOC:/CCI : CPC classification symbol/CCA: Additional information/CLC: the combination sets (C-sets) of symbols linked to the classification (CCI) or to the additional information (CCA)The first symbol of a C-set is referred to as the ""base class"". Symbols in the C-set are separated by a comma (,).The base group can be an CCI or CCA group2. C-sets in the range  -  and 2.1 This part of  relates to cement-, mortar-, concrete- and artificial stone compositions or their constituents or ingredients.As a general rule such compositions (further referred to as ""mixtures"") contain three types of ingredients:- one or more binders (organic or inorganic)- fillers (inactive ingredients)- active ingredients, e.g. accelerators.[Exception: main group  relates to compositions not containing binders].2.2 Overview of main groups:-  -  : relate to inorganic binders as such-  -  : relate to fillers-  -  : relate to active ingredients-  -  : relate to the mixtures-  : relates to characteristics / preparation of the mixtures2.3 Classification rules:2.3.1 When an invention relates to an individual ingredient, classification is made in the range  -  if this ingredient is a binder, in the range  -  if the ingredient is a filler and in the range  -  if it is an active ingredient.2.3.2 When an invention relates to a mixture, classification is made in the range  - , according to the binder used while applying the last place rule (LPR). So if a combination of an organic and an inorganic binder is present, classification is made in , not in . If a combination of two inorganic binders is present, classification is done in  according to the LPR for one of the binders, the others are added as symbols in the C-set and are chosen from - groups. If one of the ingredients is (suspected to be) new or unusual, or special details describing this ingredient are given, classification is also made for this ingredient.2.3.3 When the invention merely relates to the preparation or characteristics of the mixture, classification is made in . If the mixture as such or one of its ingredients is considered to be new or unusual, classification is made for these aspects too. For obtaining porous materials see point 3. below.2.3.4 When the invention relates to an active additive which is a mixture on its own, e.g. the combination of two specific polymers and a specific inorganic salt, classification is made in . If the use of one of the ingredients as such is new to the field, classification for this ingredient as such is made also.2.4 C-set rules:2.4.1 Primary goal of the combination set is to identify the individual constituents of the mixtures, using the classification symbols for these ingredients as part of a C-set, linked to the classification symbol which already identifies (one of) the binder(s).Example 1:A mixture containing a mixed binder of aluminium cement, Portland cement and a polymeric co-binder, next to diatomaceous earth and an inorganic sulfate will be classified - according to the LPR - in , the other ingredients being identified by the appropriate symbols in the C-set:CCI:  C-set (CLC) : , , , , An organic co-binder next to an inorganic binder is indexed as an active organic ingredient (main group ).Because in this example, all ingredients as such are known in the field, no further classification is made.2.4.2 When for one of the ingredients alternatives are mentioned, separate C-sets are made.Example 2:If in the example 1, an inorganic chloride was mentioned as an alternative to the sulfate, the indexing would look like:Set 1: , , , , Set 2: , , , , (Putting  and  in the same set would mean they are both present in the same mixture).2.4.3 When classification is made for individual (active) ingredients, their function or in some cases their characteristics can be identified using the  series.Example 3:A new organic sulfonated plasticizer:/CCI :  /CCA : When for a mixture, many alternatives for the same ingredient with a specific function are mentioned, instead of making a set for each alternative, only one C-set with the  symbol in the C-set for the function can be made. If one of the alternatives is preferred in the document a second set with the symbol for that alternative can be made too.Example 4:In a concrete mixture, a superplasticizer is added. This superplasticizer can be chosen from many alternatives, for each of which a  entry exist. However a lignosulfonate is preferred./CCI :  C-set 1 , C-set 2 , 2.4.4 In a similar way, characteristics or uses of the mixtures are identified with symbols of the  series. These symbols are always used as additional information.(CCA)Example 5:The composition of example 1 is used for sound insulation:In addition to the above sets CCA: 2.4.5 When information is given about the preparation or characteristics ofthe mixtures - this information not being the ""main"" information - additional symbols of main group  can be added in the C-set.Example 6:The mixture of example 1 is hardened using microwaves:C-set : , , , , , The mixture of example 1 is of the deferred action type:C-set: , , , , , 2.4.6 When the process of making is the main invention a CCI in  can be given. As a general rule, when classifying in , symbols in the C-set are used to identify the kind of mixture, not to identify the individual ingredients. If it is important to identify these ingredients, further classification is made as mixture and the ingredients are identified by symbols linked to the classification symbol of the mixture in the C-set.Example 7:If only common ingredients are used:/CCI :  C-set: , If also the composition of the mixture is of interest:/CCI  and C-set 1: , C-set 2: , , 2.4.7 A special case within main group  are the pre-mixtures of ingredients.Here the same principle as for point 2.4.1 is applied, i.e. the classification symbols identifying the ingredients are linked to  (CCI) and a symbol from the range  -  is added to the C-set to indicate for which kind of mixture the pre-mixture is intended to be used.Example 8:/CCI : C-set : , , , , 2.4.8 In the range for inorganic binders as such ( - ) symbols can also be used in a C-set to identify aspects for which a classification symbol exists, but which aspects as such are not important enough to be classified.Example 9:/CCI:  C-set : , Example 10:/CCI :  C-set : , 2.4.9 For agglomerated materials (= artificial aggregates or fillers), which are classified in  and subgroups, the starting materials other than the binder can be identified with further symbols in the C-set.Example 11:Making artificial gravel from a mixture of cement and mining refuse:/CCI :  C-set : , 2.4.10 Main group  is a general group for fillers. When classification is made in this group, very often the specific filler involved is identified by adding the specific filler symbol in the C-set..Example 12:Expanding perlite in a rotary kiln:/CCI:  C-set: , Example 13:Coating alumina with metal:/CCI :  C-set : , 2.4.10a Groups  and  are used in the C-set only in combination with  to indicate:-in the case of  that a coating is an alternative to the previous indicated coatingExample 14:, , , , , , , -in the case of  that the coating layer is the same as a previous coating layerExample 15:, , , , , , , 3.Classifying in main group .3.1 This part of  relates to porous or lightweight cement-, mortar-, concrete-and artificial stone compositions and porous or lightweight ceramics.More generally we could say that  relates to inorganic foamed materials or bodies, with the exception of foamed metal.Subdivision of  is largely based on the methods used for obtaining the porosity or the reduction in weight, e.g. by adding lightweight filler (), by adding a gas forming agent () or by burning out a burnable additive ().3.2 Classification and C-set rules:3.2.1 Officially in main group , there is no LPR. Nonetheless when porosity is obtained by a combination of methods, as a general rule, classification is made in the last appropriate place. The second method, not identified by classification (CCI), is identified by a  symbol in the C-set. If of interest, documents can be even classified twice (see further point 3.2.3)3.2.2 The central idea for classification/indexing in  is:- classification according to the method (see 3.2.1) and- Indicating the nature of the material that is made porous or lightweight.For identifying the nature of the material, symbols can be chosen from  - . In very exceptional cases also  symbols can be used.Example 16:Obtaining a porous silicon carbide body by dissolving out a soluble salt./CCI :  C-set: , Example 17:Obtaining porous porcelain by burning out a monolithic PUR sponge impregnated with clay slip:/CCI :  C-set : , HOWEVER there is a fundamental difference in approach when classifying ""cement type"" mixtures and ""ceramic type"" materials or bodies: see points 3.2.6 and 3.2.7 below!3.2.3 When a combination of methods is used, the method that is not identified by the classification is given a  symbol in the C-set.Example 18:To the material of example 14 there is also added a gas forming agent:/CCI :  C-set: , , 3.2.4 In the same way other aspects of interest can be identified by giving further  symbols.Example 19:The material of example 18 is characterised by the dimensions of the nanosized pores and the overall % of porosity:/CCI :  C-set: , , , , 3.2.5 When classifying in main group , in the same way as for the indexing of mixtures as described in point 2 above, symbols of the series  can be used to indicate properties are uses, e.g. sound insulation.Example 20:The material of example 17 is used for electronic applications:/CCI:  CCA :  C-set: , 3.2.6 Porous or lightweight ceramics are always classified in  according to rules 3.2.1 to 3.2.53.2.7 Porous or lightweight cement-, concrete-, artificial stone- and like mixtures:3.2.7a These type of mixtures are classified as such mixtures, so in the range  - , according to the rules of point 2 above. The appropriate  symbols are added in the C-set.Example 21:Reinforced portland cement based concrete containing also carbon fibres and made porous by adding Al particles (Al will react with Ca(OH) liberated during cement hardening and thus produce H gas):/CCI :  C-set: , , , , Example 22:Foaming gypsum by adding specific sulfonated foaming agent:/CCI:  C-set: , , 3.2.7b When one or more of the other symbols give sufficient "" information"", no further  symbols are given.Example 23:Expanded clay containing concrete will NOT receive symbol , because  already gives sufficient information:/CCI:  C-set: , 3.2.7c So as a general rule these kind of mixtures are not classified in main group . Classification is made in this main group only when the invention relates to the process of obtaining the porosity or the reduction of weight. When the composition as such is still interesting in such a case, further classification is made for the mixture.Example 24:The characteristic feature of the invention of example 21 is the way in which the Al particles are handled in the context of obtaining the gas concrete:/CCI :  and C-set 1: , , , , C-set 2: , 3.2.8 While in general the LPR is applied in main group , exception is made for obtaining porous or lightweight ceramic particles . As a general rule, this group takes precedence over the other  groups.Example 25:Obtaining porous alumina particles by burning out polymeric core:/CCI  C-set: , , 4. Classifying in main group 4.1 This part of  relates to the after-treatment of materials covered by ,i.e. after-treatment of cement-, mortar-, concrete- and artificial stone products as well as ceramic materials AND natural stone. Hereinafter the treated materials are referred to as ""substrates"".While other kinds of after-treatment are not excluded,  relates to after-treatment of substrate, mainly to :- coating or impregnation of the substrates:  and subgroups- removing material from the substrates:  and subgroups.In main group , no distinction is made between coating or impregnation. Therefore the terms coating, impregnation and layer are considered equivalent.4.2 Classification and C-set rules:4.2.1 As a general rule subdivision of main group  is based on aspects relating to the method of after-treatment, such as the selection of the method for applying the coating material on the substrate, e.g. by CVD () or the selection of the coating or impregnation material with which the substrate is treated, e.g. coating with carbon ().When using C-set, only the range  -  is used . Documents classified in the range  -  always get also a class in  - , which may be combined with one or more C-sets.4.2.2 To identify the substrate that is after-treated, the class  is given and C-sets are created using complementary symbols chosen from:-  -  when natural stone is treated-  -  when artificial stone, e.g. concrete is treated-  -  when ceramics are treated-  -  when porous materials are treated-  -  when ceramic fibres are treated, i.e. only when classifying in .When the substrate is further defined e.g. a wood fiber/particle board, which in itself is information that does not require classification in the substrate class itself e.g.  , then the  set will be:, , If a class in  is also required because the mixture per se is interesting and is part of the invention information, then the  set will comprise only the  symbolExample 26:Impregnating a natural marble stone with polyester:/CCI:  and  C-set : , Example 27:Concrete based on aluminium cement is treated with waterglass (Na-silicate):/CCI:  and  C-set : , Example 28:A silicon nitride body is glazed:/CCI:  and  C-set :, Example 29:Coating alumina fibres with aluminium:/CCI:  and C-set 1:, C-set 2: , So for classification,  takes precedence over other  groups when ceramic particles or fibres are treated!Multiple coating of particulate or fibrous material is usually also classified in  so that it is possible to attribute C-sets for each coating layer (see point 4.2.5 below).4.2.3 In main group , the LPR applies. As most subgroups relate to specific methods of applying coatings are subgroups of , while the groups identifying the nature of the coating material are further down in the scheme, this LPR in general results in a classification according to the material applied. One or more symbols identifying aspects of the method used are added in the C-set.Example 30:The process of example 26 is carried out under vacuum and increased temperature:/CCI:  and C-set 1: , C-set 2: , , However, when the invention relates to the process proper, classification is made in the process group and a further symbol is used in the C-set for identifying the applied material on the substrate. If more ample information has to be given about the nature of the coating, classification is also made for this aspect in combination with a further C-set.Example 31:The process of example 26 is carried out under an atmosphere of very specific composition, this composition being the essential feature of the invention:/CCI:  and C-set 1:, C-set 2: , Example 32:In the example 31, the polyester can be mixed with other polymers:/CCI:  and  and C-set 1: , C-set 2: , C-set 3:, , , Exception on the LPR: for classification,  takes precedence over other groups of  when treatment of ceramic fibres or particles is concerned (see example 29).4.2.4 When alternatives are to be identified, the same procedure is applied as for concrete and like mixtures, i.e. two or more C-sets of symbols are made. There might be alternatives both for the process and the material applied to the substrate.Example 33:The treatment of example 27 can be carried out either under vacuum or under inert atmosphere:/CCI:  and C-set 1: , C-set 2: , C-set 3: , 4.2.5 Multiple coating or impregnation.When the same substrate is coated with two or more layers, classification is made in . If one of the layers as such might be new in the field, classification for this layer as such is made too.For each layer a separate C-set is made, each starting with , the first set relating to the first layer, the second set relating to the second layer etc.Example 34:A clay ware body is first coated with an engobe and then with a glaze:/CCI:  and C-set 1: , C-set 2: , C-set 3: , Example 35:The engobe used in example 34 looks new to the field:/CCI:  and  and C-set 1: , C-set 2: , C-set 3: , Exception: when the different coatings result in layers of the same composition, classification is made according to the nature of that layer and  is added to the C-set !Example 36:A boron carbide body is coated with two or more layers, which might slightly differ in composition, but which all result in a carbon coating:/CCI:  and C-set 1: , C-set 2: , As for single layer coatings, additional  codes can be added to the C-set to identify other interesting aspects of the respective coatings.4.2.6 When, in the case of multiple coating, alternatives are mentioned, the following procedure is followed.If, e.g. for layer 2 an alternative is to be identified, the third C-set will represent this alternative layer, with at the end the symbol . [This symbol is not to be used for classification.] So in this case, a possible third layer will be identified by the fourth C-set, because the third one refers to an alternative of the second layer (represented by the second set).Example 37:In the example 34, a porcelain layer can be used as an alternative to the engobe layer:/CCI:  and C-set 1: , C-set 2: , C-set 3: , , C-set 4: , -When a coating layer is the same as a previous coating layer, a similar procedure as above is followed, adding the symbol  at the end of the layer that is identical to a previously identified layerExample 38C - , , - , , - , , , - , , - , , , , %2- , , 4.2.7 For the sake of classification/C-sets in , treatment of ""green"" concrete or ceramics, i.e. concrete that has not hardened yet, resp. ceramic products that are not fired yet, is considered to be covered by . Such documents will receive  as an extra symbol in the C-set.

Phenol-formaldehyde resins, as a group, are formed by a step-growth polymerization reaction that can be either acid- or base-catalysed. Since formaldehyde exists predominantly in solution as a dynamic equilibrium of methylene glycol oligomers, the concentration of the reactive form of formaldehyde depends on temperature and pH. Phenol is reactive towards formaldehyde at the ortho and para sites (sites 2, 4 and 6) allowing up to 3 units of formaldehyde to attach to the ring. The initial reaction in all cases involves the formation of a hydroxymethyl phenol: HOC H  + CH O → HOC H CH OH Novolacs (originally Novolak, the name given by Leo Baekeland), are phenol-formaldehyde resins made where the molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of less than one. The polymerization is brought to completion using acid-catalysis. The phenol units are mainly linked by methylene groups Base-catalysed phenol-formaldehyde resins are made with a formaldehyde to phenol ratio of greater than one (usually around 1.5). These resins are called resols. Phenol, formaldehyde, water and catalyst are mixed in the desired amount, depending on the resin to be formed, and are then heated Phenol - the simplest of the phenols Formaldehyde"

Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays, but there is some overlap in both particle size and other physical properties, and there are many naturally occurring deposits which include silts and also clay. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 4-5 μm, and colloid chemists use 1 μm. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg Limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 μm and silts larger. Clay minerals are hydrous aluminum phyllosilicates, sometimes with variable amounts of iron, magnesium, alkali metals, alkaline earths, and other cations. Clays have structures similar to the micas and therefore form flat hexagonal sheets Clays are commonly referred to as 1:1 or 2:1. Clays are fundamentally built of tetrahedral sheets and octahedral sheets, as described in the structure section below. A 1:1 clay would consist of one tetrahedral sheet and one octahedral sheet, and examples would be kaolinite and serpentine. A 2:1 clay consists of an octahedral sheet sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets, and examples are illite, smectite, attapulgite, and chlorite (although chlorite has an external octahedral sheet often referred to as ""brucite""). Clay minerals include the following groups:Kaolin group which includes the minerals kaolinite, dickite, halloysite, and nacrite (polymorphs of AlSiO(OH)). Some sources include the kaolinite-serpentine group due to structural similarities. Smectite group which includes dioctahedral smectites such as montmorillonite and nontronite and trioctahedral smectites for example saponite. Illite group which includes the clay-micas. Illite is the only common mineral. Chlorite group includes a wide variety of similar minerals with considerable chemical variation. Other 2:1 clay types exist such as sepiolite or attapulgite, clays with long water channels internal to their structure.

The majority of the ceramic has to be made by reaction sintering.

If aluminium is the reducing agent it is called an aluminothermic reaction. Thermites can be a diverse class of compositions. Some ""fuels"" that can be used include aluminium, magnesium, calcium, titanium, zinc, silicon, and boron and others. One commonly-used fuel in thermite mixtures is aluminium, because of its high boiling point. The oxidizers can be boron(III) oxide, silicon(IV) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, iron(III) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, copper(II) oxide, and lead(II,III,IV) oxide and others. The aluminium reduces the oxide of another metal, most commonly iron oxide, because aluminium is highly reactive: Fe O  + 2Al → 2Fe + Al O"

The normal application is to produce alumina-reinforced aluminium; the process also allows the growth of ceramic layers inside metal encasements, providing pre-stressing. A metal melt is simultaneously both oxidised and solidified, in a directional way, meaning the oxidation and solidification start at one end of the material and progress towards the other end.

Documents classified in the range  -  always get also a class in  - , which may be combined with one or more C-sets.To identify the substrate that is after-treated, the class  is given and C-sets are created using complementary codes chosen from:-  -  when natural stone is treated-  -  when artificial stone, e.g. concrete is treated-  -  when ceramics are treated-  -  when porous materials are treated-  -  when ceramic fibres are treated, i.e. only when classifying in .When the substrate is further defined e.g. a wood fiber/particle board, which in itself is information that does not require classification in the substrate class itself e.g. , then the  set will be:, , If a class in  is also required because the mixture per se is interesting and is part of the invention information, then the  set will comprise only the  symbol.When the same substrate is coated with two or more layers, classification is made in . If one of the layers as such might be new in the field, classification for this layer as such is made too.For each layer a separate C-set is made, each starting with , the first set relating to the first layer, the second set relating to the second layer etc.When, in the case of multiple coating, alternatives are mentioned, the following procedure is followed.If, e.g. for layer 2 an alternative is to be identified, the third C-set will represent this alternative layer, with at the end the code .

Myriad silicate anions can exist, and each can form compounds with many different cations. Hence this class of compounds is very large. Both minerals and synthetic materials fit in this class. Silicates are mainly a mixed oxide phase of SiO  with at least one other metal oxide, e.g. Willemite - Zn SiO , Fayalite - Fe SiO , Ferrosilite - FeSiO , Aegirine (Acmite) - NaFe Si O , Rhodonite - MnSiO ."

Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays, but there is some overlap in both particle size and other physical properties, and there are many naturally occurring deposits which include silts and also clay . The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 4-5 μm, and colloid chemists use 1 μm. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg Limits . ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 μm and silts larger. Clay minerals are hydrous aluminium phyllosilicates, sometimes with variable amounts of iron, magnesium, alkali metals, alkaline earths, and other cations. Clays have structures similar to the micas and therefore form flat hexagonal sheets Clays are commonly referred to as 1:1 or 2:1. Clays are fundamentally built of tetrahedral sheets and octahedral sheets. A 1:1 clay would consist of one tetrahedral sheet and one octahedral sheet, and examples would be kaolinite and serpentine. A 2:1 clay consists of an octahedral sheet sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets, and examples are illite, smectite, attapulgite, and chlorite (although chlorite has an external octahedral sheet often referred to as ""brucite""). Clay minerals include the following groups:Kaolin group which includes the minerals kaolinite, dickite, halloysite, and nacrite (polymorphs of AlSiO(OH) ). Some sources include the kaolinite-serpentine group due to structural similarities. Smectite group which includes dioctahedral smectites such as montmorillonite and nontronite and trioctahedral smectites for example saponite . Illite group which includes the clay-micas. Illite is the only common mineral. Chlorite group includes a wide variety of similar minerals with considerable chemical variation. Other 2:1 clay types exist such as sepiolite or attapulgite , clays with long water channels internal to their structure.

The main characteristic of SPS is that the pulsed DC current directly passes through the graphite die, as well as the powder compact, in case of conductive samples. Therefore, the heat is generated internally, in contrast to the conventional hot pressing, where the heat is provided by external heating elements. This facilitates a very high heating or cooling rate (up to 1000 K/min), hence the sintering process generally is very fast (within a few minutes). The general speed of the process ensures it has the potential of densifying powders with nanosize or nanostructure while avoiding coarsening which accompanies standard densification routes. Whether plasma is generated has not been confirmed yet, especially when non-conductive ceramic powders are compacted. It has, however, been experimentally verified that densification is enhanced by the use of a current or field. Electrical Resistance Heating (ERH) is a method that uses the flow of alternating current electricity to the ceramic. Electric current is passed through a targeted ceramic. The resistance to electrical flow that exists in the ceramic causes the formation of heat, resulting in an increase in temperature up to the desired sintering temperature."

Dielectric heating, also known as electronic heating, RF heating, high-frequency heating and diathermy, is the process in which a high-frequency alternating electric field, or radio wave or microwave electromagnetic radiation heats a dielectric material. At higher frequencies, this heating is caused by molecular dipole rotation within the dielectric. At lower frequencies in conductive fluids, other mechanisms such as ion-drag are more important in generating thermal energy. Microwaves are used for heating of various materials in cooking and various industrial processes. The rate of heating of the material depends on the energy absorption, which depends on the dielectric constant of the material. The dependence of dielectric constant on temperature varies for different materials; some materials display significant increase with increasing temperature. This behaviour, when the material gets exposed to microwaves, leads to selective local overheating, as the warmer areas are better able to accept further energy than the colder areas—potentially dangerous especially for thermal insulators, where the heat exchange between the hot spots and the rest of the material is slow. These materials are called thermal runaway materials. This phenomenon occurs in some ceramics. Electrobeam heating."

Similarly, in hexagonal crystal structures, the a and b constants are equal, and we only refer to the a and c constants. A group of lattice constants could be referred to as lattice parameters. However, the full set of lattice parameters consist of the three lattice constants and the three angles between them. For example the lattice constant for a common carbon diamond is a = 3.57Å at 300 K. The structure is equilateral although its actual shape cannot be determined from only the lattice constant. Furthermore, in real applications, typically the average lattice constant is given. As lattice constants have the dimension of length, their SI unit is the meter. Lattice constants are typically on the order of several angstroms (i.e. tenths of a nanometre).
