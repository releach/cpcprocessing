(However, for practical reasons, for example to avoid too many classification symbols, only preferred or exemplified embodiments may be classified instead of every possible entity within the scope of a formula).Generally, compounds are classified according to their chemical structure. However, in case the active ingredient is known to be a particular metabolite or derivative of the parent compound, the class for the actually active species should be given or at least also be given (see also the remarks under groups ,  or ).Salts formed between two or more organic compounds are classified as the compound providing the essential ion and it is also classified as the compound providing the other ion.Salts or metal chelates of an organic compound are classified as that compound.(However, in case the metal ion is the active species, this should be classified as well, for example as combination-sets (see below)).In this subclass, a foodstuff is not considered as an active ingredient.Different materials applied in sequence, at different times, are considered as a mixture of all materials employed. Synergistic or potentiated compositions are classified as if the synergist or potentiator is an active ingredient.With respect to the classification of mixtures of active or formulation ingredients: see combination-sets below.For this subclass the definitions of groups of chemical elements as given under the title of section  is used.In groups  -  the symbol X means nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur or a halogen; Y means nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur.

In #A1Na2, the base symbol is taken from groups -, which is followed by a subsequent symbol selected from -.That said, it is important for a C-Set under #A1Na1 and #A1Na2 to represent the linked information by the base symbol and the subsequent symbol(s), while the choice of base symbol is discretionary; See discussion in C-Sets syntax rules below.C-Sets syntax rulesEach C-Set shall contain at least two symbols.Duplicate symbols are allowed in the C-Set.The choice of base symbol is discretionary as long as the C-Set represents the relationship between the formulation-relevant ingredient and the composition ingredients. The choice of base symbol may be based on what is considered the most important aspect of the invention. In many situations, the practicality of classifying the invention with the fewest C-sets may determine the choice of the base symbol.

However, if a document discloses a limited number of examples or no examples, but the document as a whole focuses on clearly specifically preferred embodiments, such clearly specifically preferred embodiments may be classified. If a document discloses an invention including a mixture of two or more defined active ingredients as a specific formulation, C-Sets rules #A1Na1, #A1Na2 and #A1Nb are used to classify the invention.C-Sets statement: #A1Nb and #A1Nb(2300)In groups -, a mixture of active ingredients or combined application of multiple active ingredients is classified in the form of C-Sets.#A1Nb vs. #A1Nb (2300): If a mixture of active ingredients or combined application of multiple active ingredients has defined active ingredients, C-Sets rule #A1Nb applies. If the mixture of active ingredients or combined application of multiple active ingredients has at least one defined active ingredient with an undefined active ingredient, C-Sets rule #A1Nb(2300) applies.In #A1Nb, the base symbol is taken from the groups -, which is followed by subsequent symbol(s) that represent the rest of active ingredients, which is also taken from the groups -.In #A1Nb (2300), the base symbol is taken from the groups -, which is followed by the subsequent symbol .C-Sets syntax rules:Each C-Set shall contain at least two symbols.In #A1Nb, the choice of base symbol is up to the classifier as long as the relationship between the base symbol and symbols for the rest of the active ingredients and composition ingredients is maintained. The choice of base symbol may be based on what is considered the most important active ingredient, but in many situations, the practicality of classifying the invention with the fewest number of C-sets may determine the choice of the base symbol.For example, a binary mixture of a biocide represented by symbol  and a biocidal yeast is classified as either (, ) or (; ) with equal validity, but not both.A special case occurs when a mixture of three or more defined active ingredients are disclosed. In this case, the C-set is given in a cascading way. For example, a mixture of biocidal Bacillus bacteria (), biocidal yeast () and the chemical biocide represented by  requires two combination sets: (, , ) and (, ). The first C-set indicates the combination of bacteria with either yeast or chemical biocide, while the second indicates the combination of yeast with chemical biocide.Duplicate symbols are allowed in a C-Set #A1Nb. When the base symbol and a subsequent symbol are identical, the required number of C-Sets may be reduced in certain special situations. For example, a ternary mixture of two triazole fungicides epoxiconazole (), tebuconazole (), and a Bacillus strain () is classified as (, , ). Typically, a ternary mixture requires at least one more C-Set in a cascading way, but a second C-Set is not needed in this example because the information linking either of the triazole fungicides to the Bacillus strain is already covered.In #A1Nb, the order of symbols in C-sets in #A1Nb conveys the relationship between the base symbol and subsequent symbols. Only the base symbol has a relationship with the subsequent symbols and none of the subsequent symbols has a relationship with the other subsequent symbol(s). Therefore, the order of symbols in a C-set in #A1Nb is not critical when there are only two symbols in a C-set, but the order is critical when there are three or more symbols in a C-set.In #A1Nb(2300), the order of symbols in a C-set is relevant in that  is always allocated as a subsequent symbol.For an invention including a mixture of two or more defined active ingredients as a specific formulation, both C-Sets rules #A1Na and #A1Nb are used to classify the invention.C-Sets examples:#A1Nb: A mixture of glyphosate and dicamba is classified as (, ).#A1Nb: A mixture of glyphosate and 2,4-D is classified as (, ).#A1Nb: A mixture of glyphosate and a compound selected from dicamba and 2,4-D is classified as (, , ). Alternatively, it is also correct to classify the invention as two C-sets, (, ) and (, ). The first C-set (, , ) is preferable in this example because it results in fewer C-sets (one instead of two) while conveying the same information.#A1Nb: A mixture of amidosulfuron and chlorimuron is classified as (, ).#A1Nb: A mixture comprising glyphosate, dicamba, and 2,4-D: two C-sets are required in a cascading way, (, , ) and (, ).A mixture of glyphosate and dicamba, where the mixture is in the form of a wettable powder is classified as (, ) and (, , ). This is an example where both C-Sets rules #A1Na and #A1Nb must be used to classify the invention.#A01Nb(2300): A fungicidal mixture comprising a first compound selected from tebuconazole and propiconazole and a second compond selected from a long list of hundreds of compounds or a broadly written chemical structure that potentially encompasses thousands of compounds, wherein there is no specifically disclosed mixture embodiment in the disclosure is classified as (, ).C-Sets searches:C-Sets search queries may be made according to C-Sets classification rules applicable to this group and its subgroups.","A01N25/00|A01N27/00|A01N65/48|A01N27/00|A01N65/48|A01N27/00|A01N65/48|A01N27/00|A01N65/48|A01N2300/00|A01N43/90|A01N43/90|A01N63/32|A01N63/32|A01N43/90|A01N63/22|A01N63/32|A01N43/90|A01N63/22|A01N63/32|A01N43/90|A01N63/32|A01N43/90|A01N43/653|A01N43/653|A01N63/22|A01N43/653|A01N43/653|A01N63/22|A01N2300/00|A01N57/20|A01N37/40|A01N57/20|A01N39/04|A01N57/20|A01N37/40|A01N39/04|A01N57/20|A01N37/40|A01N57/20|A01N39/04|A01N57/20|A01N37/40|A01N39/04|A01N47/36|A01N47/36|A01N57/20|A01N37/40|A01N39/04|A01N37/40|A01N39/04|A01N57/20|A01N37/40|A01N25/14|A01N57/20|A01N37/40|A01N43/653|A01N2300/00","",""
