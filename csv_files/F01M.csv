"F01M","LUBRICATING OF MACHINES OR ENGINES IN GENERAL; LUBRICATING INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES; CRANKCASE VENTILATING","","Arrangement of lubricant coolers in engine cooling systems Crankshafts, connecting rods per seFluid level indicators in generalMeasuring fluid-pressure in general","F01P11/08|F16C|G01F23/00|G01L","","","EngineA device for continuously converting fluid energy into mechanical power. Thus, this term includes, for example, steam piston engines or steam turbines per se, or internal-combustion piston engines, but it excludes single-stroke devices.PumpA device for continuously raising, forcing, compressing or exhausting fluid by mechanical or other means. Thus, this term includes fans or blowers. This term also includes methods of operation, unless otherwise specifically provided for.MachineA device which could equally be an engine or a pump, but not a device which is restricted to an engine or one which is restricted to a pump.LubricantAny fluid (e.g. water, oil), fluent material (e.g. particulate graphite), semi-fluid material (e.g. oil with thickener), or semisolid material (e.g. grease), or any mixture of such types of substance, which is used for the specific purpose of lubrication.LubricationApparatus, arrangements or methods for introducing or applying a thin layer of a discrete lubricant between two or more relatively-moving adjacent solid surfaces of a device or apparatus, for the specific purpose of reducing friction, heat or wear between the adjacent surfaces.Working fluidThe driven fluid in a pump or the driving fluid in an engine. The working fluid may be in a gaseous state, i.e. compressible, or liquid. In the former case coexistence of two states is possible.Positive displacementThe way the energy of a working fluid is transformed into mechanical energy, in which variations of volume created by the working fluid in a working chamber produce equivalent displacements of the mechanical member transmitting the energy, the dynamic effect of the fluid being of minor importance, and vice-versa.Non-positive displacementThe way the energy of a working fluid is transformed into mechanical energy, by transformation of the energy of the working fluid into kinetic energy, and vice-versa.","This place covers: Lubrication of machines or engines in general, where the lubrication system, or device for lubricating parts of the machine or engine, does not form part of the structure of the machine or engine. Pressure lubrication, e.g. using pressure from pumps, crankcase pressure or the like to circulate the lubricant; including provision of lubricant passageways in crankshafts or connecting rods. Lubrication specially adapted for engines with crankcase compression of fuel/air mixtures, or for engines in which lubricant is contained in fuel, combustion air or fuel/air mixture (e.g. two-stroke engines). Heating, cooling or controlling temperature of lubricant. Lubrication means facilitating engine starting, e.g. by conditioning or heating the lubricant. Lubrication means specially adapted for facilitating the running-in or breaking-in of machines or engines. Lubricating means having other significant or pertinent characteristics, e.g. introducing additives to lubricant, using fuel as lubricant, dip, splash or drip lubrication, non-pressurised lubrication. Details, parts or accessories of lubricating, including controlling lubricant level or pressure, arrangement of lubricant conduits, purifying lubricant, filling or draining lubricant. Indicating or safety features, e.g. to render machine or engine inoperative or idling on lubricant pressure failure. Crankcase ventilating or breathing, e.g. breather valves or inlet air filters."
