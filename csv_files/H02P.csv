The DC motor can be supplied by an AC voltage or AC current. There are three types of connections used for DC electric commutator motors: series, shunt and compound.  An armature generally refers to one of the two principal electrical components of an electromechanical machine–generally in a motor or generator, but it may also mean the pole piece of a permanent magnet or electromagnet, or the moving iron part of a solenoid or relay. The other component is simply to create a magnetic field, or a magnetic flux, for the armature to interact with, so this component can comprise either permanent magnets, or electromagnets formed by a conducting coil. The armature, in contrast, must carry current so it is always a conductor or a conductive coil, oriented normal to both the field and to the direction of motion, torque (rotating machine), or force (linear machine). The armature's role is twofold. The first is to carry current crossing the field, thus creating shaft torque in a rotating machine or force in a linear machine. The second role is to generate an electromotive force (EMF). Other DC motors are: A homopolar motor, which is an electric motor that works without the need for a commutator, by rotating along a fixed axis that is parallel to the external magnetic field produced by a permanent magnet. The name homopolar indicates that the electrical polarity of the motor does not change, i.e. that it does not require commutation. Such motors necessarily have a single-turn coil, which restricts their practical applications, since they must be used with low voltages and produce relatively small torques.  A ball bearing motor, which is an electric motor that consists of two ball-bearing-type bearings, with the inner races mounted on a common conductive shaft, and the outer races connected to a high current, low voltage power supply."

The generator is a DC generator, with field windings and armature windings. The input to the amplifier is applied to the field windings, and the output comes from the armature windings. The amplifier output is usually connected to a second motor, which moves the load, such as an elevator. With this arrangement, small changes in current applied to the input, and thus the generator field, result in large changes in the output, allowing smooth speed control. Armature voltage control only controls the motor speed from zero to motor base speed. If higher motor speeds are needed the motor field current can be lowered, however by doing this the available torque at the motor armature will be reduced. Another advantage for this method is that the speed of the motor can be controlled in both directions of rotation. (From Wikipedia)."

In use, such machines are driven at constant speed by a motor. The electrical output is varied by control of field excitation, as in a Ward-Leonard system. The Metadyne and the Amplidyne include an arrangement of cross-connected brushes on one axis and a further set of brushes on a perpendicular axis. This arrangement allows the machine to provide very high gain, that is, large changes of output may be controlled by small changes in the controlling field current A rototrol (American Westinghouse Co.)The rototrol is a two-stage machine with static and dynamic characteristics similar to those of the Amplidyne.

They are multi-field single-rotor devices with two or more sets of rotating contacts (either commutators or slip rings, as required), one to provide power to one set of armature windings to turn the device, and one or more attached to other windings to produce the output current. The rotary converter can directly convert, internally, any type of electric power into any other. This includes converting between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC), three phase and single phase power, 25 Hz AC and 60 Hz AC, or many different output voltages at the same time. The size and mass of the rotor was made large so that the rotor would act as a flywheel to help smooth out any sudden surges or dropouts in the applied power.
