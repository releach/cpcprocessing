Each spanning structure including obstruction or obstacle traversing structure that provides a passageway for traffic and links or is held up by: one or more supports supported by the surface of the earth, e.g. arch-type bridges with end supports, lift-type brides with single main support, portable-type bridges with wheeled support; or one or more buoyant supports which contact a fluid type obstruction or obstacle being crossed, e.g. floating-type bridges with buoyant support. Spanning structures used for purposes other than carrying traffic, e.g. aqueducts, that are structurally similar to spanning structures for traffic and traverse the same types of obstructions and obstacles. Specially adapted components for use in spanning structures, e.g. suspension cable clamps. Accessories or ancillary devices specially adapted for use with spanning structures. e.g. drawbridge gates that are actuated when the span moves. Methods specially adapted for constructing spanning structures, e.g. specially adapted bridge erecting or assembling techniques. Methods specially adapted for restoring damaged, e.g. replacing dilapidated decking, or structurally augmenting, e.g. strengthening existing component to allow increased traffic load, existing spanning structures. Methods specially adapted for demolishing or dismantling spanning structures. Apparatus specially adapted for constructing, restoring, augmenting, or demolishing spanning structures."
