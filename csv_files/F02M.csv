"F02M","SUPPLYING COMBUSTION ENGINES IN GENERAL WITH COMBUSTIBLE MIXTURES OR CONSTITUENTS THEREOF","","Internal-combustion piston engines; Combustion engines in general","F02B","","","CarburettorsApparatus for mixing fuel with air, the fuel being brought into mixing contact with the air by lowering the air pressure, e.g. in a venturiFuel-injection apparatusApparatus for introducing fuel into a space, e.g. engine cylinder, by pressurising the fuel, e.g. by a pump acting behind the fuel, and thus includes the so-called ""solid-fuel injection"" in which liquid fuel is introduced without any admixture of gasLow-pressure fuel injectionFuel injection in which the fuel-air mixture containing fuel thus injected will be substantially compressed in the compression stroke of the enginePumping elementA single piston-cylinder unit in a reciprocating-piston fuel-injection pump or the equivalent unit in any other type of fuel-injection pump","This place covers: Apparatus for supplying fuel, air or non fuel substances to combustion engines, e.g. carburettors for liquid fuel; apparatus for feeding, or treating combustion-air, fuel, or fuel-air mixture; Fuel injection apparatus"
"F02M1/00","Carburettors with means for facilitating engine's starting or its idling below operational temperatures","","Idling devices","F02M3/00","","","IdlingEngine running stationaryPrimingPumping extra fuelFloat chamberFuel collection chamber controlled by float member","This place covers: When the engine is cold, fuel vaporizes less readily and tends to condense on the walls of the intake manifold, starving the cylinders of fuel and making the engine difficult to start; thus, a richer mixture is required to start and run the engine until it warms up. To provide the extra fuel, a choke is typically used; this is a device that restricts the flow of air at the entrance to the carburettor, before the venturi. With this restriction in place, extra vacuum is developed in the carburettor venturi, which pulls extra fuel through the main metering system to supplement the fuel being pulled from the idle and off-idle circuits. This provides the rich mixture required to sustain operation at low engine temperatures. In addition, the choke can be connected to a cam or other device which prevents the throttle plate from closing fully while the choke is in operation. This causes the engine to idle at a higher speed. Fast idle serves as a way to help the engine warm up quickly, and give a more stable idle while cold by increasing airflow throughout the intake system which helps to better atomize the cold fuel. In many carburetted cars, the choke is controlled by a cable connected to a pull-knob on the dashboard operated by the driver. In some carburetted cars it is automatically controlled by a thermostat employing a bimetallic spring, which is exposed to engine heat, or to an electric heating element. This heat may be transferred to the choke thermostat via simple convection, via engine coolant, or via air heated by the exhaust. Some carburettors do not have a choke but instead use a mixture enrichment circuit. Typically used on small engines, enricheners work by opening a secondary fuel circuit below the throttle valves. This circuit works exactly like the idle circuit, and when engaged it simply supplies extra fuel when the throttle is closed."

This reservoir is constantly replenished with fuel supplied by a fuel pump. The correct fuel level in the bowl is maintained by means of a float controlling an inlet valve When fuel is used up, the float drops, opening the inlet valve and admitting fuel. As the fuel level rises, the float rises and closes the inlet valve. The level of fuel maintained in the float bowl can usually be adjusted by a setscrew."

This job would be simple if air and gasoline were ideal fluids; in practice, however, their deviations from ideal behaviour due to viscosity, fluid drag, inertia, etc. require a great deal of complexity to compensate for exceptionally high or low engine speeds. A carburettor must provide the proper air/fuel mixture across a wide range of ambient temperatures, atmospheric pressures, engine speeds and loads and centrifugal forces, like cold start, hot start, idling, acceleration, high speed at full throttle (high load), slow speed at part throttle (light load). To function correctly under all these conditions, carburettors contain a complex set of mechanisms to support several different operating modes."
