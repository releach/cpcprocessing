Usually the bagatelle table has a rounded far end and a channel on the right hand side along which the balls are propelled. The bagatelle requires the players standing at the square end of the table hitting the balls with a cue towards the holes at the other end. Children's bagatelleConsist of marbles or balls that are shot onto a board which features areas fenced in by nails hammered into its surface. Each container scores different points depending upon the likelihood of a ball finishing in it (it is normally smaller than a bagatelle, table size).","This place covers: Games played on table-top boards or special tables, in which balls are projected from the lower end of a walled-in inclined surface (for example by means of a cue from a channel at the side of the surface) towards the higher end, which is often rounded, and roll back towards the lower end, hitting obstacles (for example metal pins) and targets (for example holes or target areas fenced in by pins) which determine the points scored."
