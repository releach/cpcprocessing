In ""by-product"" coke ovens, the gaseous and liquid by-products obtained during the carbonisation process are recovered, the principal by-products are coal tar and coke-oven gas. The coke oven gas is used to heat the ovens by combustion is external heating flues.In ""non-recovery"" or ""heat recovery"" coke ovens, the raw gas produced in the ovens is completely combusted and used to generate power.Beehive ovenEarliest type of coke oven, developed in the 1850s; its main characteristic is that the heat necessary for coking is produced by burning the volatile constituents within the oven, whereby all the gaseous and liquid by-products are lost, together with large amounts of heat.Destructive distillationThe process of pyrolysis conducted in a distillation apparatus to allow the volatile products to be collected. An example is tar making from pinewood slices (which are rich in terpenes), which are heated in an airless container causing the material to decompose, leaving charcoal and turpentine as by-products.CokeA solid, high in carbon content, and structurally in the non-graphitic state, derived from the pyrolysis of organic material (especially low-ash, low-sulphur bituminous coal) which has passed, at least in part, through a liquid or liquid-crystalline state during the carbonization process. The volatile constituents of the coal (including water, coal gas and coal-tar) are driven off by baking in an airless oven at temperatures as high as 2000 degrees C.CokingThe transformation of coal or heavy oil into coke.CarbonisationThe conversion of an organic substance into carbon or a carbon-containing residue through pyrolysis or destructive distillation.PyrolysisThe chemical decomposition of organic materials by heating in the absence of oxygen or any other reagents, except possibly steam.Ablative pyrolysisFast pyrolysis by contacting feed with hot surface, e.g. hot plate or heated wall.TorrefactionPyrolysis at temperatures below 320 degrees C.","This place covers: Retorts or coke ovens and details thereof, such as heating of coke ovens, doors or closures therefor, devices for charging or discharging coke ovens and mechanical treatments of coal charges, cooling or quenching coke, safety devices and other details.
