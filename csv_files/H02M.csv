Such generic elements are rectifiers (AC-DC-conversion), inverters (DC-AC-conversion), transformers (AC-AC-conversion), filters, regulation loops, resonance-circuits, drivers, snubbers etc. Of these generic elements only few may appear at first glance to be novel over the prior art and it serves no purpose repeatedly to classify all elements. Only those elements that appear novel should form basis for the classification.","","SMPSSwitch Mode Power Supply. A general designation for the type of power converters where power is converted in small quantities at a very rapid pace. The energy entering into the conversion circuit or out of the conversion circuit is controlled by power switches. In an SMPS the power switches are typically operated either to be fully conducting or fully non-conducting, opposite to linear voltage regulators where the power switch is used as partly conductive.ChopperChopper is another name for a switch mode circuit. Chopper refers to that the signal (energy flow) is cut-up into small amounts.ConversionIn respect of an electric variable, e.g. voltage or current, conversion means the change of one or more of the parameters of the variable, e.g. amplitude, frequency, phase, polarity.PFCPower Factor Correction. PFC relates to AC power input. Power Factor Correction is the discipline of rendering the input current sine-wave-shaped, with little harmonics and in phase with the AC input voltage. The aim is to make the AC input power load appear purely resistive for efficient use of the AC distribution network.SnubberA circuit aiming at absorbing or redirecting inductive energy generated during switched power conversion when a power switch is turned off (rendered non-conductive).
