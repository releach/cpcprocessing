"F16T","STEAM TRAPS OR LIKE APPARATUS FOR DRAINING-OFF LIQUIDS FROM ENCLOSURES PREDOMINANTLY CONTAINING GASES OR VAPOURS","","Devices, e.g. valves, for venting or aerating enclosures","F16K24/00","Attention is drawn to the definition of ""steam"" and ""vapour"". In cases where a specific entry for vapour is missing, documents related to special vapours are classified in groups where only ""steam"" is explicitly mentioned.","","","This place covers: Steam traps defined by devices or special automatic valves for discharging condensate and non condensable gases from live steam with less possible loss or consumption of live steam. Furthermore not only steam traps are covered but also all kind of apparatus or valves and component parts and accessories thereof for draining-off liquids from enclosures, gas lines, steam lines or containers containing gases or vapours. Said valves are controlled thermally (thermostatically, bi-metallically driven valves), by excess or release of pressure (thermodynamically driven valves), by floats (mechanically driven valves) or controlled without moving parts (Venturi-type or labyrinth-type)."
