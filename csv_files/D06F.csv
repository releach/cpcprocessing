A controlling process for a laundry treating apparatus (e.g. a washing machine) has a specific ""control purpose"" and implies the presence of a ""control means"" (e.g. a CPU), whereby the control means is usually a control unit which comprises a user interface (e.g. a control panel) and several sensors for the automatic detection of e.g. temperature, pressure, liquid level, etc. Moreover, the control unit is usually configured to perform actions as ""automatic output"" (e.g. switching a heater ON/OFF, regulating the drum speed, etc.), depending on the purpose of the control and based on the input of the user and/or the signals provided by the sensors. Example: washing machine - control method Control method for a washing machine employing a control unit adapted to detect the level and the temperature of the washing liquid and to switch the tub heater ON/OFF based on the laundry load, as input by the user, such as to reduce the energy consumption.

The further information relating to the (manual) input and the output of these controlling processes is classified with the mandatory indexing codes and any details of the control means per se, i.e. the ""hardware"" is classified in the groups relating to the details of the control means (see special rules of classification for this group and its subgroups). Concept The following picture schematically illustrates how a controlling process of a washing machine, washer-dryer or laundry dryer is classified based on how it works. An input signal (i.e. a user input as ""manual input"" or an automatically detected signal as ""automatic input, e.g. by a sensors) is fed into a control unit as ""control means"" which depending on the purpose of the control sends corresponding command signals to the machine components. The preceding image makes reference to the following symbols:  - ,  - ,  - ,  ,  ,  ,  . A controlling process of a laundry treating apparatus (e.g. a laundry dryer) has a specific ""control purpose"" and implies the presence of a ""control means"" (e.g. a CPU), whereby the control means is usually a control unit which comprises a user interface (e.g. a control panel) and several sensors for the automatic detection of e.g. air temperature, laundry humidity, liquid level in the condensed water tank, etc. Moreover, the control unit is usually configured to perform actions as ""automatic output"" (e.g. switching a heater ON/OFF, regulating the blower fan speed, etc.), depending on the purpose of the control and based on the input of the user and/or the signals provided by the sensors. First example: laundry dryer - control method Control method for a laundry dryer employing a control unit adapted to detect the temperature of the drying air and to switch the fan speed and the heater ON/OFF based on the target humidity of the laundry load, as input by the user, such as to reduce the operating time.  Classification of the example:  Purpose:   (Control of the operating time) Manual input:   (Target humidity for the drying process) Automatic input:   (Air properties – temperature) Automatic output:   (Electric heating);   (Blowers) Second example: washer-dryer Washer-dryer provided with a control circuit, a control panel, an air heater and a temperature sensor for measuring the temperature of the drying air, whereby the user interface allows the user to set the maximum temperature of the drying air, and the control unit is configured to regulate the heater (e.g. by switching it ON/OFF) and the blower fan based on the temperature of the drying air. The control aims to avoid damaging the laundry by overheating.  Classification of the example:  Purpose:   (Control of the operational steps, e.g. optimisation or improvement of operational steps depending on the condition of the laundry) Manual input:   (Target temperature for the drying process, e.g. low-temperature cycles) Automatic input:   (Air properties – Temperature) Automatic output:   (Electric heating);   (Blowers) Note: All washer-dryers have to be also classified, as a general rule, in  ."
