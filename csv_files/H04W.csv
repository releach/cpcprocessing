(""signalling channel"", e.g. paging channel, broadcast channel, pilot channel).Core network, CN 3GPP standard terminology. PLMN architecture is divided into Core Network (CN) and Access Network (AN).

Circuit Switched domain (CS domain) refers to the set of all core network entities offering ""circuit switched type of connection"" for user traffic and for the related signalling. Dedicated network resources are allocated at connection establishment and released at connection release. Entities specific to the CS domain are: MSC, GMSC, VLR. The Packet Switched domain (PS domain, Packet domain) refers to the set of all core network entities offering ""packet switched type of connection"" for user traffic and for supporting the related signalling. Transports user information using autonomous concatenation of bits called packets: each packet can be routed independently from the previous one. PS domain includes General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Evolved Packet Core (EPC). Entities specific to the PS domain are: SGSN, GGSN, PDN GW, S-GW, MME, SGSN. CS and PS domains also have common network entities: e.g, HSS, HLRDownlinkmeans the wireless link from a wireless access point or network towards the user or terminal equipment (see also ""uplink"").Fixed allocation (of a dedicated resource)allocation of a resource that is not changed with each frame or time slot.

This requires the usage of a shared channel. Serving networkdesignate the part of the network to which the access point providing user's access is connected.
