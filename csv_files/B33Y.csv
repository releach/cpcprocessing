In particular it covers processes, apparatus, materials, and other aspects of additive manufacturing, i.e., making, repairing, or modifying articles of manufacture by the selective application of multiple layers of material. The applied layers may be applied directly, as in a printing process, or by selective solidification of material onto a substrate or previously developed layers, for example, by selective sintering of a particulate."
