"C05F3/00","Fertilisers from human or animal excrements, e.g. manure","","","","Documents relating to a manure composition or process for its preparation in combination with an apparatus for obtaining thereof are classified as the Combination-set (,  ).Mixtures of these fertilizers with other fertilizers belonging individually to other groups of the classification will be given a Combination-set as explained in the Note under .","C05F3/00|C05F3/06|C05","","This place covers: Fertilisers from animal excrements, manure, liquid manure, etc."
"C05F3/06","Apparatus for the manufacture","","","","Apparatus to manufacture fertilisers are classified primarily in the corresponding groups of the  field. All information contained in a document, claims but also examples or other part of the description can be classified if they are considered to contain relevant information in the field.Group  covers all apparatus for the manufacture of fertilisers from excrements of animal or human origin.Since the group has no further subdivisions all documents relating to these sorts of apparatus should be classified in this group.If the structure of the apparatus contains technical details relevant for classification in other fields, extra symbols in other relevant fields might be given. This group is non-limiting, i.e. it is possible to have documents classified here and in other relevant groups. As an example, a bio-mass processing system wherein one or more mixers, mixes a bed of bio-mass material such as manure in a defined length and width portion of the bed, in a dryer, is classified in  but also in  (machines or apparatus for drying solid materials) and  (heating arrangements).","C05|C05F3/06|C05F3/06|F26B9/00|F26B23/00","","This place covers: Apparatus for the manufacture of fertilisers from excrements of animal or human origin."
