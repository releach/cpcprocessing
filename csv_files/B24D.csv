It is characterised by a comparatively high material removal rate.Polishing means mechanically finishing the surface of a work so as to improve, e.g. smoothen, its surface, without substantial change of dimension or shape of the work as would occur in grinding.Abrading is used in its most general sense to mean mechanically removing material by a multitude of fixed or loose particles that are forced into the surface of the work so that each particle cuts away small chips of material.Cutting is used in the sense that an abrasive grain functions as a microscopic single-point cutting edge and shears a chip, analogous to what is conventionally called a ""cut"" chip.","This place covers: Grinding, polishing or sharpening tools for working on any material.
