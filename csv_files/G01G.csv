"G01G1/00","Weighing apparatus involving the use of a counterweight or other counterbalancing mass","","","","","","","This place covers: Weighing devices and methods wherein the mass of an object is determined by balancing its gravitational mass with another known gravitational mass. These comprise mostly vertically hinged pendulum weighing devices with integrated counterweights and balances with a mostly horizontally hinged beam adapted to support removable counterweights. The main difference between both kinds of weighing devices is given by the way the measurement of mass is established Within pendulum weighing devices the deflection angle of the pendulum is translated to a mass measurement. Within weighing devices with a horizontally hinged beam mass measurement is performed by balancing with a collection of known masses or by considering the distance of the counterweight towards the hinge. For pendulum weighing devices counterweights might also be adapted to be arranged with a variable distance towards the hinge in order to switch to different ranges of mass."

Exceptionally inertial mass instead of heavy mass is measured by microbalances such as quartz crystal microbalances (QCM) in  . Microbalances comprise a substrate that is stimulated to vibration. The substrate changes its characteristic frequency once an object of a certain mass is adsorbed. The object's mass is determined by the frequency shift. Substrates may consist of quartz crystals such as piezoelectric material that is actively stimulated to vibration by an AC voltage. These microbalances are commonly referred to as quartz crystal microbalances (QCM). Substrates may also consist of micromachined material such as silicon. Stimulation to vibration is commonly performed by interlocking combs that are charged by opposing AC voltage. Further details of subgroups ; This subgroup comprises only passive piezo-electric weighing elements, wherein active deformation due to the weighing force is generating a voltage within the piezo-electric weighing elements. Therefore this subgroup does not comprise piezo-electric resonators as used within quartz crystal microbalances. ; This subgroup comprises all active piezo-electric weighing elements, meaning that a voltage is applied to the piezo-electric weighing element in order to cause a deformation of this element. Examples are piezo-electric resonators used within quartz crystal microbalances."
