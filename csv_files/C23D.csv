Enamelling is here only the coating of metals with vitreous powders in dry form, in dispersion or mixed with a polymeric binder (e.g. transfer sheets) that will disappear during burning without leaving byproducts. The heat treatment is here to melt the powder and eventually to burn the carrier, when present. The coating of metal with glass can be done by the same processes as enamelling, by coating with molten glass."
