Controlling aspects of space crafts are excluded from the . They should be classified in . Otherwise, classification is made in the most appropriate place in this subclass.Places where there is specific provision of the kind referred to above at a detailed level have been listed under the main groups of this subclass (see ""References relevant to classification in this subclass""). Where the provision is at a general level (e.g. of a kind appropriate to more than one of the main groups specified in the lists, or to main groups  or ), the places are listed under this subclass.A document that can be applied to two or more applications is not specific for any of them and has to be classified in  (for instance a thermostat for heating or air conditioning).A formulation of the kind ""regulator for the application X"" should a priori not be considered as specific to said application.Usually, the subdivisions of the regulation classes in the field of the application are less precise than in , therefore giving a class in  may be useful for search.When in a document there is mention of several controlled variables, one should try to visualize the block scheme of the regulation. The document is then to be classified in the group of the variable controlled in the outer control loop. In case the regulation in one of the other control loops is of particular interest, it should also be classified in the group(s) of the variable(s) concerned.Note that the above is without prejudice of the limiting references contained in the titles of the different groups and subgroups in this subclass.In the main groups of this subclass, remarks found under ""Further details of subgroups"" are not meant to replace the definitions in the titles, but either give further information about the definitions or mention particular types of documents to be classified in the subgroups or to be excluded from them. In case no remark is made on a given subgroup, the title is considered to be self-explanatory.In , the hierarchy in classification is generally done according:- to the physical variable- Then to the nature of the auxiliary power used, with the following possibilities, not used for all the variables:without auxiliary power (purely mechanical regulation)with auxiliary non-electric power (e.g. pneumatic or hydraulic)characterised by the use of electric meanswith combination of electric and non-electric auxiliary power- Then, to the type of sensor used.","A21B1/40|B23K9/095|G05D|B64G1/244|G05D27/00|G05D29/00|G05D|G05D|G05D|G05D","Systemsincludes self-contained devices such as speed governors, pressure regulators","This place covers: Systems for controlling or regulating non-electric variables, in particular: position, trajectory, attitude or altitude of a vehicle; position or direction of an object; thickness or size of materials; flow rate; level; quantity ratio; linear or angular speed; force or stress; fluid pressure; torque or mechanical power; vibrations; chemical variables; humidity; temperature; viscosity; and illumination. ""controlling"" means influencing a variable in any way, e.g. changing its direction or its value (including changing it to or from zero), maintaining it constant, limiting its range of variation. ""regulation"" means maintaining a variable automatically at a desired value or within a desired range of values. The desired value or range may be fixed, or manually varied, or may vary with time according to a predeterminated ""programme"" or according to variation of another variable. Regulation is a form of control. Merely acting on a variable for the purpose of influencing the state of a system (e.g. acting on the fuel flow rate in an engine for achieving a certain speed), where the value of the variable itself remains irrelevant, should a priori not be considered as controlling or regulating said variable."
