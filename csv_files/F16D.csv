This definition is not followed, since ""the addition to the prior art"" of most documents is not always clear. In subclass  the criteria for classification derive from the main rule that all relevant technical information of a document is classified to allow efficient retrieval. Most documents should preferably have two or more classification symbols. One symbol to describe the general configuration or overall construction and one or more further symbols to identify additional features should be assigned.To avoid duplication of entries for the same subject matter, most of the existing subgroups relating to the type of operation force (e.g. hydraulic) are no longer used for classification. Instead the codes relating to brake actuation in groups  -  are given to each document.Examples:A hydraulically actuated band brake previously classified in IPC group  is classified according the rules in  and .A hydraulically and magnetically actuated band brake also classified in IPC group  is classified according the rules in , ,  and .","F16D|F16D1/00|F16D48/00|F16D2300/00|F16D1/00|F16D48/00|F16D2500/00|F16D48/00|F16D71/04|F16D48/00|F16D71/04|F16D|F16D2121/00|F16D2131/00|F16D49/12|F16D49/08|F16D2121/04|F16D49/12|F16D49/08|F16D2121/04|F16D2121/20|F16D2123/00","ActuatorA component of a mechanism that causes movement of a motion-conveying component or motion-inhibiting component but does not itself directly convey or inhibit motion.BrakeA mechanism with at least one component that is moved by an actuator to selectively or automatically engage or stop a member with respect to a stationary part.
