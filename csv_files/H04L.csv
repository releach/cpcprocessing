Considering N subcarriers, SLM performs M multiple parallel N point IFFTs, each using a different N-phase vector (one phase value applied to each subcarrier) and selects out of the M outputs the resulting time domain OFDM with the lowest PAPR value. PTS divides the N subcarriers in V disjoint subcarriers subsets, multiplies each by a phase value and performs V partial IFFT before adding the resulting V outputs producing the OFDM symbol to be sent.

This alternative meaning was mainly introduced by most BitTorrent tracker sites.Overlay networkComputer network built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay can be thought of as being connected by virtual or logical links, each of which corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network.P2PPeer to Peer.PeerA participant of a peer to peer network, in which participants act as both client and server. In BitTorrent, a peer is one instance of a BitTorrent client running on a computer on the Internet to which other clients connect and transfer data. Usually a peer does not have the complete file, but only parts of it. However, in the colloquial definition, ""peer"" can be used to refer to any participant in a swarm (in this case, it's synonymous with ""client"").Peer to Peer networkThose networks which exhibit the following two characteristics: 1.- Symmetric Communication: Peer nodes act both as clients and as servers (""Servents""). Peer nodes are considered equals; they both request and offer resources, rather than being confined to either client or server roles. 2.- Self-Organization: The peer nodes automatically organize themselves into an application layer overlay network and adapt to the arrival, departure and failure of nodes.Seed / Seeder:Peer that offers a piece of content for upload. In BitTorrent, a Seed is used to refer to a peer who has 100% of the data. When a leech obtains 100% of the data, that peer automatically becomes a Seed.Seeding:Uploading content to other peers. In BitTorrent, Seeding refers to leaving a peer's connection available for other peers, i.e. leechers, to download from. Normally, a peer should seed more data than leech. However, whether to seed or not, or how much to seed, is dependent on the availability of leeches and the choice of the peer at the seeding end.SwarmGroup of peers downloading file pieces, in parallel, from several distinct sources or uploaders of the file. In BitTorrent, together, all peers (including seeders) sharing a torrent are called a swarm. For example, six ordinary peers and two seeders make a swarm of eight.TorrentA torrent can mean either a .torrent metadata file (see next) or all files described by it, depending on context. Torrents work by dividing the target file into small information chunks, found on an unlimited number of different hosts. Through this method, torrents are able to download large files quickly. When a client (the recipient of a target file) has initiated a torrent download, the chunks of target file that are needed can be found easily, based on the data from the torrent itself. Once all the chunks are downloaded the client can assemble them into a usable form. Torrent fileA BitTorrent tracker is a server that assists in the communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol. Clients that have already begun downloading also communicate with the tracker periodically to negotiate with newer peers and provide statistics; however, after the initial reception of peer data, peer communication can continue without a tracker. A tracker should be differentiated from a BitTorrent index by the fact that it does not necessarily list files that are being tracked. A BitTorrent index is a list of .torrent files, usually including descriptions and other information. Trackers merely coordinate communication between peers attempting to download the payload of the torrents. Many BitTorrent websites act as both tracker and index. Sites such as these publicize the tracker's URL and allow users to upload torrents to the index with the tracker's URL embedded in them, providing all the features necessary to initiate a download.","This place covers: Documents describing specific functionalities, architectural details or applications of Peer to Peer (P2P) networks. P2P networks are those which exhibit the following two characteristics: Symmetric Communication: Peer nodes act both as clients and as servers (""Servents""). Peer nodes are considered equals; they both request and offer resources, rather than being confined to either client or server roles. Self-Organization: The peer nodes automatically organize themselves into an application layer overlay network and adapt to the arrival, departure and failure of nodes. Note: The academic definition feature ""distributed control"" is not considered because of the existence of P2P networks which make use of a node /some nodes which centralize certain functions in the p2p network (e.g. the central server of Napster; the ""tracker nodes"" of BitTorrent - on a ""file per file"" basis)."

Telewriting: the (remote ) reproduction by means of a telecommunication system of the movements of a pointing device (for example a pen writing ""electronic ink"" into a digitizer tablet or a touch screen) in a remote display, in such a way as to transmit the handwriting of a user to a remote user. The information to be transmitted consists of the coordinates of the position of the pointing device and the movement vector, or similar representations of position and movement. Networked virtual reality, networked simulation, networked games: transmitting to (remote) user device(s) the movements and interactions (i.e. shooting weapons in an aircraft combat simulation) of a 2D/3D representation of an entity (person, animal, vehicle, aircraft, avatar, etc...) in such a way that this entity can be represented in a display at the remote device, so as to enable the two (or more) users to interact with each other by means of the representation of the entity. The information to be transmitted here is more complex, and is dependent on the characteristics of the entity. It can include orientation, position, speed/velocity, rotation, acceleration, movement of sub-components of the entity (i.e. movement of an arm of a robot), interactions (i.e. shooting of weapons, change of colours, audio, voice, etc..), etc... The distinction between virtual reality, simulation or game is one of purpose of the interaction: in the networked simulation case the purpose is to teach the user in the control of an entity; in the networked games the purpose is entertainment. The devices used are classified in different places in the classification, see references below. The protocols adapted to these kinds of applications are very specific, and contain a lot of application information in the protocol itself. For example, the transmission of packets to the participants in a simulation, which is of a multicast nature, is sometimes restricted to those objects for which the information is relevant: movements of a mobile out of sight of a participant (behind an obstacle or mountain, or very far away) are not relevant, and are thus not transmitted, to avoid congestion in the network. Protocols, like X-windows, that separate the GUI (Graphical User Interface) elements from an application from the rest of the application, and locate these GUI elements in a network node remote from the node in which the rest of the application functionality resides."

The standards for TCP/IP are published in a series of documents called Requests for Comments (RFCs). RFCs are an evolving series of reports, proposals for protocols, and protocol standards that describe the internal workings of TCP/IP and the Internet. Layer 3 - Network The Internetwork Protocol (IP) as the network layer interface is responsible for routing, directing datagrams from one network to another. The network layer may have to break large datagrams, larger than MTU, into smaller packets and host receiving the packet will have to reassemble the fragmented datagram. Layer 4 - Transport Transport layer subdivides user-buffer into network-buffer sized datagrams and enforces desired transmission control. Two transport protocols, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), sits at the transport layer. Reliability and speed are the primary difference between these two protocols. TCP establishes connections between two hosts on the network through 'sockets' which are determined by the IP address and port number. TCP keeps track of the packet delivery order and the packets that must be resent. Maintaining this information for each connection makes TCP a stateful protocol. UDP on the other hand provides a low overhead transmission service, but with less error checking."
