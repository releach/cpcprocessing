The permanent attachment can be performed by continuous or discontinuous stitching or otherwise, e.g. by adhesive or with binding elements like clips or finger, claw, or ring-like elements passing through the sheets. Usually, continuous stitching unites several quires or signatures to a book block with a single piece of thread. Discontinuous stitching usually uses wire staples to unite a single set of flat or folded sheets, usually comprising already a back or cover sheet, to a block or booklet. The binding of collated flat sheets is usually performed by block stitching in a binding margin, the binding of folded sheets is usually performed by saddle stitching along the fold.
