Also classified are independent claims defining galenical aspects of a pharmaceutical composition or a medical use.All relevant galenical aspects must be classified.The one dot groups of  do not follow the last place ruleIn principle all examples are classified, also 'standard' examples in documents describing e.g. a new medical use.However, systematically classifying all excipients in the examples is not necessary, and often undesirable. In any case classified are excipients which are described as being important for the invention, or which the reader can identify as having an important function, e.g. for sustained release. For 'standard' compositions the examiner should choose one or a few excipients to classify. (Note: A 'standard' example is an example that is simple and does not appear to be part of the invention. For instance in a document relating to the new medical use of a (new) chemical compound, often some compositions are given which are 'standard' (if not hypothetical): a tablet with e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate, an injection solution with NaCl, etc.In any case such examples should be classified, whether considered 'standard' or not. In how far all excipients in such compositions are classified is left to the classifier's discretion).When there are too many examples, they can sometimes be covered by a more general class. However, head groups should not be used for this. ( A ""head"" group does not have the same meaning as a main group. With ""head group"" is meant a group which is further subdivided in such a way that classification can always be made in one of the lower groups. For instance  is a head group,  is a head group, as well as . In principle such head groups should be empty. is the head group for the drug release techniques (see Definition statement). Only its subgroups are used for classification, when relevant.  is empty; there is no general sustained release group.Animal tests to study pharmacokinetic properties of a drug are not classified, unless it is absolutely clear that they represent the intended mode of administration. (Note: What is meant here, are pharmacokinetic tests in animals, e.g. by injection or gavage. Such tests usually say nothing about the final intended dosage forms, but are necessary e.g. for regulatory purposes. The value of their pharmaceutical/galenical information is therefore very low. Exceptions are perhaps inhalation tests in animals, as these are normally only done with drugs intended to be inhaled).Processes for preparing a composition, even when claimed, are only classified if they appear of interest.The description and dependent claims are not classified. However, if the document as a whole focuses on one clearly preferred embodiment, this embodiment may be classified, even in the absence of relevant examples or independent claims. The intention here is primarily to avoid that all lists in the dependent claims are fully classified (e.g. all tablet excipients for sustained release, while only one is used in the examples).If a specific subcombination is claimed, such a subcombination will usually be reflected in the examples, which should in any case be classified. And if this subcombination is not reflected in examples, but clearly forms the invention (following e.g. the description), then it also should be classified. In all other cases, the specific subcombination is probably not inventive, so no need to classify.In general, information relating to the invention is classified using invention information symbols, while additional information is classified using additional information symbols. This is largely up to the discretion of the examiner. Please note however the following special situations:Normally only final compositions are classified, not intermediates. However, it may be useful to classify intermediates as additional information (e.g. a tablet comprising microcapsules; a multicoated microparticle). If the intermediates are claimed separately, they must be classified as invention information.If, in the classification scheme, a group refers out to another group, an additional information symbol may still be given for the first group (e.g. oral mucoadhesive film).","A61K9/00|A61K9/2004|A61K9/0012|A61K9/0002|A61K9/0002|A61K9/0002","Microemulsionany emulsion with a particle size below 1 μmMicroparticleparticle having a size between 1 μm and about 3 mmMicrosphere homogenous or multi-nuclear particle having a size between 1 μm and about 3 mmMicrocapsulecapsule or coated particle having a size between 1 μm and about 3 mmNanoparticle, nanocapsule(coated) particle or capsule having a size below 1 μm","This place covers: Pharmaceutical compositions which are characterised by the following galenical aspects: The form (e.g. tablets) (see also ""Special rules"" section) The site of application, i.e. the body location where they are administered (e.g. oral, nasal, rectal compositions) The drug release technique (e.g. effervescent compositions, osmotic delivery systems) In addition, the following is also classified: Processes of making such compositions Medical uses characterised by any of the above galenical aspects (dosage form, site of application, release technique) Excipients for use in a specific dosage form (e.g. tableting excipients) In   ""Galenic"" form"" relates to pharmaceutical (drug delivery) compositions in general.

In the absence of specific compounds, generic formulae (Markush formulae) are to be classified.In principle all specific compounds mentioned in the claims are classified. However, when there are too many compounds, as in the case of lengthy lists, classification is to be limited to a reasonable number of assignments, i.e. 10-15 compounds, covering e.g. the compounds tested, or the more significant compounds. Any generalisation to the next hierarchically higher level is to be avoided.How are compounds classified?When a compound is only and exclusively defined in the application by means of functional definitions, and no specific examples at all are provided, the main group  will be assigned provided it is clear that the intended compound is an organic compound falling under . However, should the application refer to said functionally defined compounds as being e.g. inorganic compounds, peptides, proteins, antigens or antibodies, then  is not to be assigned.Combinations or mixtures of pharmaceutically active compounds are classified in the appropriate  subgroup followed by  in the corresponding Combination-set for each active ingredient. This also applies to mixtures comprising novel compounds receiving  classification. However, the combination of an organic therapeutically active compound with a specified excipient (e.g. crospovidone and mannitol) is not to be considered as a mixture of two therapeutically active ingredients and therefore no Combination-set is to be created. In this case, the assignment of the appropriate symbol in  for the excipient(s) may be required.Salts or complexes of organic active compounds are classified according to the corresponding free compounds. However, salts or complexes formed between two or more organic active compounds are classified according to all compounds forming the salts or complexes followed by with  to create the corresponding Combination-set (i.e. as a mixture of active organic compounds).According to the last place rule, salts formed between an organic active compound and heavy metals should be classified in  -  and not in subgroups  - ,  or . This does not apply to complexes with heavy metals, as apparent from the  scheme, wherein the complexes hemin and hematin are classified in  and cyanocobalamin in .If a subgroup title is the name of a specific compound or a group of specific compounds (e.g.  ""Retinoic acid"",  ""Ascorbic acid"",  ""Pyridoxine"") only exactly the compounds named are classified in this group (not derivatives thereof). For instance  covers retinoic acid, but not derivatives thereof. However, salts of retinoic acid or ascorbic acid still fall under the respective subgroup for the acid.On the other hand, when a compound is mentioned in the group title only as an example (""e.g.""), such as in  ""1,4-oxazines, e.g. morpholine"", the scope is not limited to this example.A fusion heteroatom, i.e. a heteroatom which is shared by two (or more) rings in a fused ring system is to be counted for all adjacent rings.
