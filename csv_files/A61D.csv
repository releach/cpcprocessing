"A61D","VETERINARY INSTRUMENTS, IMPLEMENTS, TOOLS, OR METHODS","","","","","","","This place covers: Apparatus (i.e. instruments, implements, machines, structures, tools) or processes for enhancing or controlling the breeding of companion, domesticated, exotic, or wild animals (e.g. artificial vaginas, uterus disinfecting means), wherein the apparatus or processes are specially adapted to be only usable with animals. Apparatus (i.e. instruments, implements, machines, structures, tools) or processes limited to use in the treatment, reconstruction, removal or replacement of the teeth, gums, or other parts within the mouth of companion, domesticated, exotic, or wild animals for medical purposes (i.e. dentistry), wherein the apparatus or processes are specially adapted to be only usable with animals and for dental procedures. Apparatus (i.e. instruments, implements, machines, structures, tools) or processes for introducing medication (e.g. vaccines) or other material having an effect on bodily functions (e.g. seminal fluids, euthanasia poisons, stimulants) into or onto the bodies of companion, domesticated, exotic, or wild animals, wherein the apparatus or processes are specially adapted to be only usable with animals and for medical purposes. Apparatus (i.e. instruments, implements, machines, structures, tools) or processes for medical procedures that employ physical actions on portions of companion, domesticated, exotic, or wild animal bodies to correct, enhance, inspect, or treat them (i.e. surgery), wherein the apparatus or processes are specially adapted to be only usable with animals and for medical procedures. Animal surgery consists of the following medical procedures: repositioning (e.g. aligning broken bones, opening wounds) or removing (e.g. cropping tails) parts of animal bodies; stabilizing (e.g. inserting bone pins) to prevent harmful movement of parts of animal bodies; repairing (e.g. cauterizing beaks) animal bodies; facilitating the occurrence of naturally occurring bodily functions (e.g. degassing stomachs, death) that are out of the ordinary; introducing, collecting, or removing cells or organs to or from animal bodies; and introducing or taking out foreign objects (e.g. bullets) to or from animal bodies. Apparatus (i.e. instruments, implements, machines, structures, tools) or processes for evaluating, examining, measuring, monitoring, studying, or testing particular characteristics and aspects of the bodies of companion, domesticated, exotic, or wild animals (i.e. diagnosis), wherein the apparatus or processes are specially adapted to be only usable with animals and for medical purposes. Animal diagnosis consists of scrutinizing the following characteristics or aspects of animal bodies: internal (e.g. lungs) or external (e.g. hooves) portions of the bodies; abnormal bodily conditions (e.g. detecting foreign bodies); inappropriate mental conditions (e.g. neurobiological-based compulsions or unacceptable psychological behavior), and bodily functions (e.g. vision). Implements, devices, or materials exclusively for animals that are: designed to be placed on or cover sores (e.g. blisters, boils) or wounds (e.g. cuts, abrasions) for extended periods of time (i.e. at least several minutes, but frequently for days) during their healing process to absorb fluids from, protect, or medicate them (e.g. poultices) and specially adapted to be only usable with companion, domesticated, exotic, or wild animals. Adjunct, auxiliary, or supplementary structures or means (e.g. operating tables, clean rooms) that are specially adapted to be only usable with companion, domesticated, exotic, or wild animals during their diagnosis, dentistry, surgery, or for other medical purposes. These adjunct, auxiliary, or supplementary structures or means contribute to the effectiveness (e.g. washing devices) or safety (e.g. handling gloves, mouth openers) of medical procedures, but may or may not themselves involve direct contact with the animal's body (e.g. thermometer holder). Specially adapted components of apparatus having structural features limiting them to use with diagnostic, dental, or surgical apparatus for animals. Accessories specially adapted for use with the above types of apparatus, means, or structures. All other types of apparatus (i.e. instruments, implements, machines, structures, tools) or processes that are not specifically provided for in another subclass which are: utilized for medical treatment of companion, domesticated, exotic, or wild animals; typically used only in an animal hospital-like facility or by animal medical personnel, and only useable with animals."
