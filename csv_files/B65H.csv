Subject matter covered by these groups is classified in the following internal groups:/IPC covered by /EC/IPC covered by /EC;/IPC covered by /EC, /EC;/IPC not used;/IPC not used;Note 1:The  scheme is applied in combination with the  scheme for classifying complementary information which is judged to be of particular interest. The  scheme is divided into the following themes: - Particular handling processes; -  - Constructional aspects such as material choices, machine elements, parts having special functions, specific machines; -  - Control aspects such as sensing, measuring, actuating, adjusting; - Problem to be solved; - Handled material/article; - Application field;In particular at least one of the following symbols should be given. - Nature of material - Form of handled article or web - Specific article or web - Application fieldhowever, if for example a document already has a  symbol there is no need for adding  ""envelopes or articles of mail"";if for example a document already has a  symbol there is no need for adding  ""Scanning""Indexing codes of groups  -  and  can be combined with the following symbols relating to additional characteristics or to further specify the information. The additional symbols have the meanings indicated below: - Indicates that the first Indexing Code relates to an entity as a function of which control, adjustment or change is performed (input); - Indicates that the first Indexing Code relates to an entity which is controlled, adjusted or changed by a control process (output); - Indicates that the first Indexing Code relates to an entity which is measured, estimated, evaluated, calculated or determined but which is not adjusted or changed by the control process per se; - For distinguishing ""adjusting"" from controlling i.e. manual adjustments; - For distinguishing changing an entity in function of another entity purely by mechanical means i.e. no electronics involved; - Indicates that several of an entity are present; - Indicates that the code exclusively relates to machine elements, (to be combined with one of the indicators  - ). can also be combined with other symbols when it is important to mark that several of an entity are presentIndexing Codes of groups  can be combined with additional symbols  and/or  to indicate additional characteristics. The addition has the following meaning: - For indicating a transport device whose receiving section is involved in the transfer; - For indicating a transport device whose delivering section is involved in the transfer;,  - For indicating a transport device whose both receiving and delivering section are involved in the transfer;Examples relating to the additional symbols:Code ,  relates to control as a function of the distance between items of handled material or between handled material and machine elements, whereas the code , ,  relates to control as a function of the distance exclusively between machine elements, e.g. the nip between cylinders;A document disclosing a device and/or method for controlling responsive to a wrong distance between articles successively separated from a pile of article, monitoring said distance by checking the time intervals () between the parsing of the front edges of the articles (), and responding by changing the rotational speed of the separator (), should be classified in: , + , + , or + .If the device and/or method for controlling is not the main but only an additional aspect of the invention the  symbols can be given without the symbol If the rotational speed of the separator is changed manually by the operator the last code should be + Only the following  entries should always be used for the  groups related to filamentary material: - Type of handled material; - Storage means; - Handles; - Manual tools;Note 2:If it is judged that handling aspects are relevant for both articles being fed to a process and for articles being fed from a process, they should be classified in the groups concerning ""feeding to processes"" as well as in the groups concerning ""feeding from processes"" unless precedence notes dictate otherwise.Note 3a:When judging whether subject-matter is to be considered as being more ""intimately associated "" with operations on the thin or filamentary material than with the handling of the material per se, it should be judged whether the handling aspect, in particular the handling problem to be solved, could be understood per se without referring to the particular operation, or in other words, whether the handling of the material is technically inseparable from the respective operation. If the handling aspect is clearly inseparable from the operation, then this aspect should be classified only in the subclass relevant for that operation. If the handling aspect is clearly separable from the operation, then the aspect should only be classified in  (see examples type A).Note 3b:In many cases, however, such a clear distinction concerning the technical separabillity cannot be made. In such cases, the subject-matter should be classified both in  and the subclass concerning the operation action per se. If it is judged, that the handling aspects to a large extent are technically separable from the operation, but the operation nevertheless has some bearing on the handling, then the subject-matter should be classified in the relevant  groups combined with an  symbol indicating the operation in the form of an application field (see example type B).Example type A:A document disclosing that the feeding speed of a piece of paper in an ink jet printer is controlled as a function of the ongoing printing operation should be classified in  and not in .Example type B:A document discloses handling means for replenishing the pile of paper sheets from which sheets are continuously separated and fed to an off-set printing machine without having to stop the printing machine. The printing process as such only has a bearing on the replenishing means (handling means) in as much as the size of the handling means is dictated by the size of the off-set printing machine. Such a document should be classified in  together with the  symbol for ""industrial size printers, e.g. rotary printing press"".","B65H49/02|B65H49/18|B65H51/00|B65H51/20|B65H54/26|B65H54/28|B65H54/34|B65H54/70|B65H45/02|B65H54/76|B65H57/00|B65H59/00|B65H61/00|B65H63/00|B65H67/00|B65H69/00|B65H71/00|B65H49/36|B65H54/54|B65H75/24|B65H81/08|D01D7/02|D01D5/096|D01G25/00|D01G37/00|D01H1/18|D01H13/00|D01H1/36|D01H13/06|D01H1/38|D01H11/00|D01H7/18|D01H13/02|D01H13/04|D01H13/10|D01H13/14|D01H13/32|D01H9/00|D01H4/48|D01H15/00|D01H13/30|D01H7/16|D02G1/14|D02G3/36|D02H1/00|D02H13/12|D02H13/22|D02H13/02|D02J13/00|D03D39/06|D03D47/34|D03D49/16|D03D49/04|D03D51/18|D03J1/00|D03J1/16|D03J1/02|D03J1/04|D04B15/38|D04B15/48|D04B35/32|D04B15/54|D04B15/44|D04B35/10|D04B35/24|D04H1/70|D05C15/18|D05C11/08|D06B23/02|B65H19/16|B65H19/1889|B65H35/07|B65H35/0006|B65H77/00|B65H23/00|B65H59/00|B65H79/00|B65H99/00|B65H|B65H|B65H|B65H2301/00|B65H2401/00|B65H2408/40|B65H2511/00|B65H2557/62|B65H2601/00|B65H2701/00|B65H2801/00|B65H2701/17|B65H2701/18|B65H2701/19|B65H2801/00|B07C|B65H2701/1916|H04N|B65H2801/39|B65H2511/00|B65H2519/00|B65H2701/13|B65H2220/01|B65H2220/02|B65H2220/03|B65H2220/04|B65H2220/08|B65H2220/09|B65H2220/11|B65H2220/01|B65H2220/09|B65H2220/09|B65H2301/447|B65H2220/01|B65H2220/02|B65H2220/01|B65H2220/02|B65H2220/01|B65H2220/02|B65H2511/22|B65H2220/01|B65H2511/22|B65H2220/01|B65H2220/11|B65H2513/53|B65H2701/1311|B65H2513/11|B65H7/02|B65H2701/1311|B65H2220/01|B65H2513/53|B65H2220/03|B65H2513/11|B65H2220/02|B65H|B65H7/02|B65H2513/11|B65H2220/04|B65H|B65H|B65H2701/30|B65H2701/50|B65H2402/412|B65H2402/414|B65H|B65H|B65H|B65H2801/00|B41J|B65H|B65H1/30|B65H2801/21","PackageA mass of filamentary material, formed by coiling, depositing, or winding, with or without a supporting core or former or an enclosing container or receptacle.HandlingSeparating, orientating/positioning, feeding, gathering, collecting, storing, folding (other than in the manufacture of products), unwinding, and winding.Filamentary materialIncludes thread, wires, ropes, cables, and hoses.Thin materialSheets, signatures, envelopes, blanks, and thin piles thereof (hereinafter referred to as ""articles""), and webs, tapes, and films, e.g. of paper, fabric, metal foil, or plastics.","This place covers: Handling aspects of general interest relating to thin material in the form of ""separate articles"" such as sheets, signatures, envelopes, blanks, cards, and thin piles thereof.
