Vehicle  This term has been used with the following two variations in meaning within this subclass: (1) all varieties of apparatus (e.g. automobiles) intended to carry people or goods significant distances (e.g. between cities, to or from separate building complexes) across land, over water, or through the air except those restricted to one of the following types: rail vehicles, waterborne vessels, aircraft, space vehicles, hand carts, cycles, animal-drawn vehicles, or sledges. Moreover, the term ""vehicle"" also includes (i) vehicular characteristics which are common to more than one of the above-listed types of vehicles, (ii) certain characteristics restricted to automobiles, road trailers, or cross-country trailers, and (iii) all land vehicles having characteristics specifically adapted for occupant safety such as air bags, seat belts, or safety harnesses. (2) In some instances in this definition, the term ""vehicle"" has been qualified by another word which takes its meaning outside the scope of (1) above (e.g. ""rail vehicle""), in such cases the word ""vehicle"" takes its broader dictionary meaning.
