The structure is either made of articulated elements () or from a single flat element (flat-type wiper blade ). A flat-type wiper blade should always either get an EC or an Indexing Code under  even if only visible on the figures (this remark is particularly relevant for documents concerned with connectors for wiper blade and wiper arm).Warning : A series of Indexing Codes  -  does not have a corresponding EC classification. They are however to be used when their titles correspond specifically to the wiper blades described in the documents.The flat-type wiper blades  have a corresponding EC/Indexing Code scheme except for  (only Indexing Code). Here the general rule applies: Invention information under EC - Additional information under Indexing CodeThe blade-arm connection does not have a corresponding EC or Indexing Code scheme. Some specific details of connections are only present in the Indexing Code scheme. The document got usually the best relevant EC classification. If the best classification is an Indexing Code symbol, this Indexing Code is given together with one EC and other Indexing Codes related to additional information.","B60S1/04|B60S1/44|B60S1/04|B60S1/08|B60S1/166|B60S1/18|B60S1/24|B60S1/34|B60S1/38|B60S1/40|B60S1/3801|B60S1/3848|B60S1/3848|B60S2001/3812|B60S2001/3846|B60S1/3848|B60S2001/3898","","This place covers: Cleaning devices used for cleaning any parts of the vehicle and being fixed to the vehicle (defogging devices, wipers for windscreen or rear windows, nozzles distributing washing liquid, scrapers fixed to the wheels, ...).
