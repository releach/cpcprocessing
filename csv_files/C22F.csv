When occurring at room temperature the process is termed ""natural aging"", while a process that occurs when subjecting the metal alloy to elevated temperature is termed ""artificial aging"". Aging for a longer time than that corresponding to maximum strength or hardness at the particular temperature is termed ""over-ageing"".HardeningThe increase in resistance to deformationPrecipitation hardening As the quenched alloy ages, a new material precipitates out of the metallic crystal lattice, filling in abutting spaces, and increasing hardness NormalizingA process of heating metallic material above its critical temperature and cooling in air thereby establishing a fine uniform grain size and improving the microstructural uniformityQuenchingThe rapid cooling of metallic material either from elevated temperature to room temperature or cooling of metal to sub-ambient temperature, at a specific rate, with a given medium. TemperingHeating of a previously quenched or normalized metallic material to an elevated temperature, and then cooling under suitable conditions to obtain the desired mechanical properties.","This place covers: Changing the physical (metallurgical) structure of non-ferrous metals or alloys by heat treatment or by hot or cold working; Changing the physical structure of non-ferrous metals or alloys by special physical methods, e.g. treatment with neutrons.
