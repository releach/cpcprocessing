"D21C","PRODUCTION OF CELLULOSE BY REMOVING NON-CELLULOSE SUBSTANCES FROM CELLULOSE-CONTAINING MATERIALS; REGENERATION OF PULPING LIQUORS; APPARATUS THEREFOR","","","","The main aspect(s) of the invention is/are given a class according to the classification scheme. The invention per se should be classified in the last appropriate class(es), if possible. Ideally, one class should be given for covering the main aspect of the invention per se. Exceptionally, the core of the invention may also be classified by using several classes (up to three)Classification of additional informationIn this subclass, it is highly desirable to add Indexing Codes for secondary aspects of the invention (e.g. the features of the dependent claims) or for additional information, which is not considered to form the claimed invention per se, but which might be of interest for the search. For the Indexing Codes the ""D"" is replaced with an , e.g. to classify the additional information that the pulp is treated by an enzyme (or microorganisms ) should read  (instead of ).","""N""|D21C5/005|D21C5/005","PulpA dispersion [e.g. a aqueous suspension] comprising cellulosic fibres and optional additives; it may also be referred to as ""stock"", furnish"" or ""slurry"".Lignocellulosic materialCellulosic material which also comprises lignin.
