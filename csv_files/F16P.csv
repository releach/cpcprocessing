"F16P","SAFETY DEVICES IN GENERAL; {SAFETY DEVICES FOR PRESSES}","","","","  is only related to general use and general configuration of safety systems. More detailed systems, or specific features of these systems should be classified in the corresponding subclasses. For example a general description of a light grid used to avoid a person to enter a dangerous area has to be classified in , however if the invention is related to a specific feature of the light grid (e.g. detailing the elctronical circuits or the light grid) and not linked directly to the safety,  should not be given but rather .","F16P|F16P|F16P|G01V","","This place covers: Safety systems allowing protection of the operator from a machine, a machine tool, a press.
