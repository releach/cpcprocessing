The silencing apparatus are divided mainly in two types: resonance and throttling. Under resonance the definition is that the exhaust gas does not flow through the resonator chamber or pipe, only the sound waves do. Most common resonators are Helmholtz chambers and 1/4 wave pipes. On the other hand under throttling the definition is that the exhaust gas has to flow through the throttling chamber or pipe. Most common throttling method is using an expansion chamber. Note that nowadays both types can be combined together in a single silencer. Further silencing effect is achieved adding a sound absorbing material to the chambers or pipes. Some samples of subgroups  - by passing the gases through a mass of particles  - the gases passing through porous members  - using transversal baffles defining a tortuous path for the gases or successively throttling gas flow  - the gases flowing through the silencer two or more times longitudinally in opposite directions, e.g. using parallel or concentric tubes  - using a central core throttling gas passage  - having means to impart whirling motion to the gases  - using tangential inlets into a circular chamber  - using vanes arranged on gas flow path or gas flow tubes with tangentially directed apertures  - using two or more expansion chambers in series Movable parts are provided for regulation purposes, this is the place to classify them. The only exception are the exhaust brakes, which are classified in   and subgroups. Examples of the subgroups under  :  - for adjusting flow area, e.g. by means of a valve  - for changing gas flow path through the silencer or for adjusting the dimensions of a chamber or a pipe"
