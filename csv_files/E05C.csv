"E05C","BOLTS OR FASTENING DEVICES FOR WINGS, SPECIALLY FOR DOORS OR WINDOWS  (latching means for sideboard or tailgate structures for vehicles B62D, {B62D33/02}; fastening devices for constructional or engineering elements E04, F16B; locks, fastening devices structurally or operatively combined or having significant cooperation with locks E05B; means for operating or controlling wing fasteners in conjunction with mechanisms for moving the wing E05F)","B62D|B62D33/02|E04|F16B|E05B|E05F","","","In this subclass, only the movement essential for securing the wing is considered, e.g. a sliding bolt which is rotated on its axis to prevent its withdrawal is classified as having only a sliding movement.","","WingGeneral term for swingable, slidable, or otherwise movable doors or windows. This term also includes other movable structures such as drawers, lids of chests, car boots, or car bonnets, to which the operating, mounting, latching, or locking means covered by this class may be applied.Frame Any member to which a wing may be held by a fastening device. It does not include a framework forming part of the wing, but it may be another wing.LockPrimarily a device for releasing or securing any member, which requires a key or a permutation mechanism for release. Bolt A sliding, pivoted, or otherwise movable member such as is normally carried by a door to hold it shut by engagement with a keeper on the frame. It may be operated by hand directly or through mechanism or by a key; it may be a latch (see below);Latch A bolt arranged to be moved to the releasing position against the force of a spring, or some other returning force, when a wing meets the frame on closing, so that it does not have to be operated by hand to secure the wing, but only to open it.HaspA member hinged to the frame or wing so that it can be moved towards the face of the wing or frame and secured thereto, e.g. by a turn-button, by a padlock and staple.","This place covers: Bolts or fastening devices for swingable, slidable, or otherwise movable wings, e.g. doors or windows. This subclass has the following structure:    -    Fastening devices characterised by the way the bolt is moved.     Fastening devices specially adapted for two wings.     Arrangements of simultaneously actuated bolts or other securing devices at well separated positions on the same wing.     Fastening devices for holding wings open.   ,    Other devices specially designed for securing wings."
