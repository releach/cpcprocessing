It covers also steam or vapour accumulators and power plants which are characterised by steam or heat accumulators, by the use of specific types of engines and by condensers and by the use of steam or condensate extracted from the power plant. Furthermore general lay-out, control and methods of operation of complete power plants and methods of converting heat or fluid energy into mechanical energy are covered."
