Ply yarns are preferred where durability is all-important.Cabled or cord yarnsyarns comprising two or more plied yarns twisted together. In general they are constructed by twisting the plied yarns around each other successively in the opposite direction of the preceding twist, i.e. S/Z/S or Z/S/Z. As a result, the opposite twist directions cause the plies to grip each other and maintain adherence. These yarns are hard, rough and strong.","This place covers: US-A-2004/0065072 US-A-2005/0009430 US-A-3 690 056"
