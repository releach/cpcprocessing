"F03B1/00","Engines of impulse type, i.e. turbines with jets of high-velocity liquid impinging on blades or like rotors, e.g. Pelton wheels; Parts or details peculiar thereto","","","","","","","This place covers: Engines of impulse type, i.e. turbines with jets of high-velocity liquid impinging on blades or like rotors, e.g. Pelton wheels; Parts or details peculiar thereto. In these engines the energy - usually potential - of the liquid is entirely transformed into kinetic energy (or momentum) in the nozzle system, before the liquid reaches the runner or rotor. Another way of defining these engines is to say that in an impulse turbine the runner or rotor is not enclosed by a pressurised space or casing, but placed within a space which is normally at atmospheric pressure.

"F03B3/00","Machines or engines of reaction type; Parts or details peculiar thereto","","","","","","","This place covers: Machines or engines of reaction type; Parts or details peculiar thereto. A reaction type machine or engine in which the potential energy of the liquid is transformed into mechanical energy partly in the stator and partly in the rotor, in other words the fluid is forced to accelerate by a decrease in the available cross reaction, in both sections. Both the stator and rotor spaces are completely filled with the liquid whilst in operation, at a pressure higher than atmospheric. A special case is when all the energy is transformed in the rotor, the so called Hero's turbine. FR935827"
"F03B3/08","with pressure-velocity transformation exclusively in rotors","","","","","","","This place covers: Turbines in which all the potential energy of the liquid is transformed by acceleration in the rotor itself, causing the reaction which drives the turbine. The typical example is the Greek Hero's turbine - although that one was driven by steam. A rotating garden sprinkler uses this effect. WO9612872"
"F03B7/00","Water wheels {(of swinging flap type F03B17/06)}","F03B17/06","","","When the device uses a flow with a minimal gradient, like a slow river, just enough to maintain the flow, documents should be classified in ","F03B17/06","","This place covers: Water wheels which convert the potential energy of the liquid due to height differences, in this case up to a few meters. The channels conveying the fluid to the water wheel are open to atmosphere. The traditional distinction between overshot and undershot water wheels refers to whether the point of introduction of the fluid onto the wheel is above or below the axis of rotation of the wheel. This distinction is not reflected (yet) in the classification. Undershot water wheels use small gradients, but greater that the minimum incline which would still cause flow. They often have no buckets but blades. An Archimedes screw is also a water wheel in this sense when it extracts power from the potential difference on the fluid. Examples: Overshot Undershot Archimedes screw"
"F03B9/00","Endless-chain machines or engines","","","","","","","This place covers: Machines where the collecting and transmitting the energy of a fluid is done with the help of a flexible continuous member closing on itself, which is maintained in place whilst moving with the help of rotating elements.  The flexible continuous member can be made of hinged elements ( as a bicycle chain) or consist of an elongated member also closing on itself, like a rope loop or a belt. This flexible continuous member closing on itself ( ""sans-fin"" in French, also internationally known) is held in place whilst it travels by usually two, sometimes more than two, rotating guiding elements, like pulleys or toothed wheels. Usually the elements directly interacting with the fluid flow (collecting its energy), in the form of buckets or paddles, are attached to the flexible continuous member at regular intervals along its length. Any device using these elements in   is either a water wheel (see   and subdivisions), or a machine using only the kinetic energy of a liquid flow (see   and subdivisions).The group   is therefore not used anymore for classifying new documents. Instead classify in the corresponding water wheel or liquid flow machine groups; that is, any hydraulic motor involving an endless chain arrangement should be classified in either water wheels   or in machines using liquid flow  ."
