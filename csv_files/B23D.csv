Both the tool and the workpiece are non-rotating. The process is similar to turning () except that in turning either the tool is moved around the workpiece in a circular path or the workpiece is rotated. In turning the tool path is therefore circular with respect to the workpiece whereas in planing the toolpath is non-helical.SlottingThe production of a slot by a process similar to planing, i.e. the removal of material in the form of chips by a relative movement of at least one tool with a geometrically defined cutting edge relative to a workpiece along a non-circular trajectory.ShearingTo fracture material through the application of a load transverse to the material surface(s) on which the load is applied.BroachingMethod of machining by chip removal employing a multi-toothed cutting tool in which the functional edges of the tool teeth are so related to one another that the tip of one tooth extends further than that of an adjacent tooth from a datum line interior to the tool extending parallel to the path of relative movement between tool and work and in whose operation the teeth successively engage the work, each tooth or set of teeth removing an amount of material determined by its relationship to the adjacent tooth.FilingRemoval of material in the form of chips by a tool having multiple geometrically defined cutting edges arranged at similar distances from a datum line interior to the tool extending parallel to the path of relative movement between tool and work in order to produce a surface of predetermined form.RaspingFiling with a course file with multiple geometrically defined raised teeth usually formed in a sheet of metal by deformation of the sheetSawingThe division of a workpiece into two or more parts using a tool with a toothed, grinding or friction edge by removing material in the form of chips, dust or molten material.ScrapingRemoval of material by a tool, generally a hand tool, comprising a geometrically defined cutting edge, used primarily to alter surface characteristics of the workpiece, rather than change the geometry. Examples include deburring by scraping (i.e. removal of sharp corners) and ""roughening"" of ground machine tool slideways to provide oil pockets.Like operationsOperations which remove metal through a geometrically defined cutting edge but for which no other provision exists within the entire classification scheme.","This place covers: Planing, slotting, shearing, broaching, sawing, filing. scraping like operations for working metal by removing metal not otherwise provided for.."
